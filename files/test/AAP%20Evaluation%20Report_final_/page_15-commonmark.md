officers, and the scope of the evaluation not including more robust
methodologies such as counterfactual and statistical techniques, this
evaluation is often only able to identify perceived weakness and
strengths, rather than being able to evaluate actual weaknesses and
strengths. In such areas, the evaluation should be understood as
inviting further analysis and assessment, which the authors highly
encourage IOM to undertake.

#### Ethical Considerations … page 15

The evaluation adhered to the ethical guidelines established by the
United Nations Evaluation Group (Table 2).

Source: United Nations Evaluation Group (2020). In addition to following
the aforementioned principles, the evaluation team implemented the
following steps:

1.  Informing all consulted stakeholders that their participation was
    part of an evaluation aimed at enhancing overall IOM work rather
    than assessing needs or gathering information for current or future
    interventions.
2.  Clarifying to interlocutors that the evaluators were independent
    professionals, not IOM officers, and assuring them that any shared
    information would be anonymized when integrated into findings and
    recommendations.
3.  Exercising significant caution and respect during FGDs with groups
    experiencing conflicts due to diverse ethnic and national
    identities.
4.  Referring any assistance requests received from affected persons
    during FGDs or other interactions to the relevant IOM officer.
5.  Attentively listening to field stakeholders’ significant concerns
    and referring these to the CED as appropriate.
