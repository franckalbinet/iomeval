- Conduct a comprehensive assessment of all CFM systems currently in use
  within IOM.
- Identify overlaps, gaps and areas for improvement in existing
  mechanisms.
- Establish minimum standards and ensure compliance.
- Define clear minimum standards for CFM systems to ensure consistency,
  efficiency and accessibility.
- Implement measures to ensure that all mapped CFMs align with these
  standards.
- Develop and disseminate CFM-specific materials.
- Create guidance documents, training materials and communication
  resources to support the effective implementation of CFMs.
- Ensure dissemination across all relevant teams and offices.
- Move towards standardization and integration.
- Work towards harmonizing CFM systems across IOM to ensure uniformity
  in processes and reporting.
- Facilitate the integration of CFMs into broader corporate systems for
  streamlined data collection and analysis. This recommendation relates
  to the many findings regarding CFMs in this evaluation, and in
  particular to how CFM development and management processes are being
  undertaken in autonomy by different offices or departments within IOM,
  resulting in duplication of effort and missed opportunities for
  efficiency and synergy. Central AAP functions are therefore
  recommended to control and regulate CFM-related processes and outputs
  more actively.

New guidance on developing and managing CFMs should cover both
technological and organizational aspects, with the former focusing on
minimum standards and compliance, and the latter promoting the
development of office-wide CFM systems with clear processes, roles and
responsibilities for the various functions available in the office.

Noting also how CFM development has happened outside of institutional
system development and management processes, after having established
minimum standards, in particular on data protection, cybersecurity and
data utilization (as the prevalent perception of informants was that not
all CFM data are analysed and used), IOM should move towards the
institutionalization of the more promising CFM systems available within
IOM and beyond, possibly through a transparent, open selection process.

Recommendation 9: IOM more broadly, and the AAP team more specifically,
should continue the collaboration and engagement on collective
accountability, actively participating in coordination structures on
AAP, such as IASC-promoted initiatives or initiatives developed in other
inter-agency coordination spaces, both at the global and country level.

To follow up this specific recommendation, the following activities
should be implemented:

- Disseminate best practices on collective accountability and
  inter-agency coordination, including on the implementation of joint
  projects such as inter-agency CFMs or other similar initiatives, and
  conduct specific training courses on this matter.
