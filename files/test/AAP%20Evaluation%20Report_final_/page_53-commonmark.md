#### Background … page 53

Consultations in Türkiye took place between 4 and 8 March 2024 and were
conducted by the evaluator. These entailed 12 KIIs, as well as five FGDs
attended by a total of 57 individuals ( 26 women and 31 men).
Consultations were conducted in the IOM Ankara Country Office and in the
Gaziantep Suboffice.

Türkiye was selected for a case study following the suggestion of the
AAP unit in IOM Headquarters, with the intention of focusing on AAP in
the context of IOM Türkiye’s crossborder operations with Syria. The
evaluator decided to also include in the scope of the consultations
AAP-related initiatives undertaken for IOM Türkiye’s refugee response
operations, in order to gain a more comprehensive view of AAP in the
country office and to see how AAP activities undertaken by the two
different programmes interrelated. Additional interviews were also held
with programme officers in Ankara not working on either of the two
initiatives, to gauge the extent of AAP implementation in other
operational domains.

#### Türkiye Context … page 53

In IOM Türkiye, at the time of this evaluation, there was a structured
CFM specifically set up for the cross-border operations between Türkiye
and Syria. This system was managed from the Gaziantep Suboffice by the
cross-border programme. Another CFM was set up for the refugee response
programme and was led by the monitoring and evaluation unit, also in
Gaziantep. The monitoring and evaluation unit and the cross-border
programme unit were observed to work quite independently of each other.

The monitoring and evaluation system for cross-border operations was
designed in a context where implementation relied to a large extent on
the implementing partners, and IOM needed an effective system to monitor
progress and assess whether or not the programme activities were being
executed properly. As illustrated in Figure 8, the monitoring and
evaluation system was articulated in three components: a commodity
tracking system; third-party monitoring; and AAP. The commodity tracking
system applied a unique barcode-based identification number to every
single kit delivered to beneficiaries, <sup>30</sup> allowing the
beneficiary to confirm whether they received the assistance or not.
Third-party monitoring was implemented by Kudra Social Development
Solutions, a partner with presence in both Syria and Türkiye (Gaziantep)
contracted by IOM to manage beneficiary verification, distribution
monitoring and exit interviews, post-distribution monitoring, and
satisfaction surveys. A CFM designated as the “Dialogue, Information and
Participation System” (DIPS) was established in late 2018. It consisted
of a hotline together with mechanisms to share information and collect
complaints and feedback via WhatsApp. Figure 8 also refers to
“endorsement”: an important responsibility

\[^0\] \[^0\]: <sup>30</sup> According to IOM Türkiye officers, the
commodity tracking system tracks the movement of humanitarian supplies
from the IOM warehouse in Gaziantep to the intended locations in Syria.
The system allows IOM to know that a shipment reached its intended
delivery location, and the specific time it did, which strengthens
accountability and transparency in all distributions. Every kit released
from the IOM warehouse is tagged with a unique QR code. Each QR code
bears information of the type and quantity of each item included in the
kit. Warehouse staff scan the QR code upon release of the kit from the
warehouse. Once kits arrive in partners’ warehouses and during
distributions, partners scan the QR code using GPS-enabled mobile
devices. Thus, each QR code is linked to a recipient beneficiary. The
data for location, date and time of distribution, and beneficiary
details are automatically uploaded to a secured and encrypted server.
