This report details the findings from an external evaluation of the IOM
strategy for AAP carried out between November 2023 and June 2024.

### Evaluation Context … page 9

IOM follows the IASC definition of AAP, which describes it as “an active
commitment to use power responsibly by taking account of, giving account
to, and being held to account by the people humanitarian organisations
seek to assist” (IASC, 2015). Since the 1990s, the AAP agenda has
significantly expanded within the humanitarian response field. It has
evolved through the humanitarian reform process that followed the IASC
Humanitarian response review (2005), the IASC Transformative Agenda
(2011), the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) (2016) and the IASC Grand
Bargain platform (2016). These changes have all contributed to
emphasizing the needs, perspectives and rights of affected people rather
than viewing them as merely the passive recipients of assistance.

In 2020, IOM introduced the AAP Framework, which became a mandatory
instruction (IN/285) in 2021. This framework was created following
guidance from IASC. Furthermore, activities related to AAP were tracked
in several pilot countries over three years to help define the framework
and monitor the implementation. Türkiye was one of these pilot
countries.

Within the IOM organizational framework, the responsibility for AAP
initially fell to the Department of Operations and Emergencies, which
was recently restructured into the Department of Humanitarian Response
and Recovery (DHRR). This department was assigned the first global
coordination focal point. In 2024, by decision of the IOM Director
General, responsibility for AAP was transferred to the Protection
Division. At the time of writing this background, the AAP Coordination
Unit, comprising four team members, operated within the Protection
Division.

As outlined in the AAP Framework, “IOM’s foundation for action on AAP is
firmly rooted in several key IOM strategic documents…. The AAP Framework
brings these provisions together for a consolidated institutional
approach” (IOM, 2020c:6). These key strategic documents include the
Migration Crisis Operational Framework (MC/2355), the Humanitarian
Policy (C/106/CRP/20) and the Gender Equality Policy
(C/106/INF/8/REV.1). <sup>2</sup> The obligatory aspect of the AAP
Framework means that all forthcoming policies and guidelines “must
adequately represent and take the IOM AAP Framework into account” (IOM,
2020c:6). The AAP Framework outlines five objectives aimed at enhancing
the IOM approach to AAP and integrating it into IOM actions. These
objectives focus on leadership; information-sharing and transparency;
participation; complaints and feedback mechanisms; and partner
coordination. The AAP Coordination Unit is tasked with promoting and
overseeing AAP activities within the Organization, as well as
representing IOM in pertinent AAP forums. Their activities include

Conduct (IN/15, REV. 1), the Policy and Procedures for Preventing and
Responding to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (IN/234), the IOM Data
Protection Principles (IN/00138), the guidance note on how to mainstream
protection across IOM crisis response (IN/232), and the IOM Reporting
and Investigation of Misconduct Framework (IN/275).
