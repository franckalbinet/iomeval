material. Two different surveys may be developed to cover the data
collection needs, one internal focusing on IOM and the other on external
partners. EVA and RG will examine the possibility to conduct surveys
with selected populations, for instance through the case studies, and
identify sources that can document the views of affected populations
(IOM needs assessments, as well as satisfaction and household surveys
for instance).

EVA and the RG will also discuss sampling of initiatives, programs,
research, evaluations, and other relevant documents that can be used as
case studies or illustration of IOM’s work related to AAP, to be
finalized during the inception phase in consultation with the
consultant(s). They may include three to fiveprograms based on the
geographical and financial criteria. Field visits covering case studies
may be organized, to be decided during the inception phase. The
methodology will be further refined in the inception report.

The use of various data collection tools (documentation review,
interviews, mapping, evidence assessment and surveys) will facilitate
triangulation of information collected, thereby increasing the
reliability of the findings, lessons learned, good practices and
recommendations that will be presented inthe evaluation report. A draft
evaluation report will be sent to the RG for comments after having been
cleared by EVA.

The evaluation is expected to start in September 2023 and a final report
should be made available in February 2024 at the latest. EVA will cover
the costs for the recruitment of the external consultant(s) and will be
responsible for the overall implementation and management of the
exercise. Participatory workshop may be organized to discuss preliminary
findings, lessons learned and recommendations prior to the finalization
of the evaluation report.
