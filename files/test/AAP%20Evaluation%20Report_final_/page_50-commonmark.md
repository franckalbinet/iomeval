However, the presence of a dedicated AAP adviser or coordinator
supporting the IAAWG and its co-chairs is seen as essential to ensure
coherence and maintain momentum in AAP implementation. The role requires
significant technical expertise and coordination capacity. At the time
of the evaluation, while an AAP adviser had been made available through
stand-by partner agreements with IOM (in 2023) and OCHA (in 2024), no
sustainable funding mechanism was in place to ensure the continuation of
this role, putting in potential jeopardy the progress made in the
previous years.

##### Impact and Results … page 50

The toll-free hotline service established by IOM Ethiopia was perceived
as a valuable resource. DTM teams have been informing communities of the
hotline service, increasing the volume of calls. The fact that the
service is toll free was also seen as important to facilitate access by
affected people. The Community Voices dashboard is seen as an important
achievement as it makes analysed CFM data available to a wide range of
stakeholders, including civil society. This is done with the intent of
informing decision-making.

While a proper impact assessment is outside the scope of this evaluation
and case study, examples were provided of how AAP implementation led to
changes in assistance provision, including administrative measures such
as staff dismissals or partnership discontinuations due to misconduct.
In one case, community complaints regarding discrepancies in cash
assistance due to currency exchange rate variations from United States
dollars to Ethiopian birr led IOM to a change in the conversion method,
to ensure that cash grant amounts are based on the latest exchange rate.
In another, reports of food aid diversion made by affected people
prompted the establishment of a dedicated task force to investigate the
reports and take action. The integration and application of AAP within
the food cluster was also perceived as impactful.

##### Sustainability … page 50

The systematic integration of AAP into projects (“mainstreaming”)
requires that AAP components are included from the design stage and that
budgets allocate resources specifically to AAP. As mentioned already,
projects developed by IOM Ethiopia do often include a dedicated AAP
budget allocation, and AAP is integrated into projects’ narratives. This
is not formally required in IOM at large but only recommended. As a
result, the mainstreaming of AAP in IOM Ethiopia’s programming remains
subject to mission decisions and priorities, notwithstanding the fact
that this country office made a significant effort and dedicated
significant resources to AAP. Some informants pointed out how AAP is
still not prioritized as it should be in project design and
implementation. One informant stated that, in a situation where
stringent budget constraints are faced, AAP is highly likely to be the
first thing to be sacrificed. <sup>29</sup>

AAP implementation success also critically depends on understanding its
concepts and technical aspects. Training was seen as necessary to this
process, but not entirely sufficient, as

officers is mandatory for every IOM mission; however, there is no
similar requirement in the case of AAP. Thus, AAP application is mainly
being implemented by focal persons.
