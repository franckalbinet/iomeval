compacts in 2018: the global compact on refugees and the global compact
for safe, orderly and regular migration (GCM). Accountability, respect,
and fulfilment of the rights of migrants and internally displaced
persons (IDPs), including protection, are also reflected in the Agenda
on Internal Displacement and the Organization’s Strategic Vision.

Saving lives, assisting, protecting, and working closely with all
vulnerable groups and mobile populations affected by crisis are at the
core of International Organization for Migration (IOM) operations.
Responsive programming and project implementation in IOM require
engaging affected populations in processes and decision-making early on,
from needs assessments that aim to correctly identify their needs and
contextual suitability including within communities, to program
implementation and sustainablecompletion. The AAP Framework
2020<sup>3</sup> establishes IOM’s common approach and commitments for
implementing and mainstreaming AAP and is mandatory throughout its
crisis-related work as contained in its Migration Crisis Operational
Framework 2012 and its Addendum of 2021. The framework was developed in
line with the IASC commitments to AAP and adapted to meet IOM’s
operational realities. The management of AAP in IOM is mainly the
responsibility of the Department of Humanitarian Response and Recovery
(DHRR), which works closely with other IOM entities for mainstreaming
it, such as the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual
Harassment Unit (PSEAH).

IOM collaborates with Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian
affairs (OCHA), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC), World Food Programme
(WFP), United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF),
and non- governmental actors in the domain of AAP and coordinates its
work and contribution via IASC timebound Task Forces (TFs), responsible
for delivering the Operational Policy and Advocacy Group
(OPAG)-endorsednormative work for the 2022-2023.

### EVALUATION OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE … page 85

Since AAP is high on the IASC and IOM’s agendas, IOM’s Central
Evaluation Unit (EVA) considered strategically relevant to perform a
comprehensive assessment of IOM’s work and performance in this areaand
included it in its Biennial Evaluation Plan 2023-2024. The overall
objective is to evaluate IOM’s strategic, institutional, and operational
approach to AAP, and to provide recommendations and lessonslearned on
how to further streamline, raise awareness on and advocate for AAP
principles and commitments for the populations and communities IOM
serves.

More specifically, the evaluation will examine IOM’s global engagement
with AAP in crisis-related and noncrisis settings, including its
policies, strategies, and programmatic approaches set-up since 2016
(which corresponds to the issuance of new IASC policies, WHS and New
York Declaration), to take stock of internal and external synergies,
adaptations and institutional steps adopted by IOM for an effective
andsustained approach to AAP. It will identify good practices and areas
of improvement regarding IOM’s decision-making, policymaking, technical
guidance, and programme implementation for a comprehensiveand
collaborative AAP approach, as well as for external coherence with UN
agencies, organizations, and governments. The 2019 Multilateral
Organization Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN) review of IOM noted
improvements in AAP with the development of the framework, but
highlighted that some key

populations through leadership, information-sharing and transparency,
participation, complaints and feedback mechanisms and partner
coordination.
