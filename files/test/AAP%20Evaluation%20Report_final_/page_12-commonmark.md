#### Remote and In-Person Key Informant Interviews … page 12

An initial list of informants to be interviewed was received from IOM,
to which additional individuals were added based on the consultations
that took place to produce this evaluation’s inception report. The final
list included IOM staff at various levels (Headquarters, regional and
national), as well as individuals from partner organizations. All
interviews with IOM informants in Headquarters were conducted remotely
through Zoom and generally lasted between 45 and 60 minutes. For the
case studies, the interviews were conducted in person. Government
officials and partners at the local level were interviewed for the case
studies, in addition to IOM staff and partners in the relevant IOM
country offices.

#### Focus Group Discussions … page 12

FGDs were conducted to facilitate debate, allowing the observation of
power dynamics, consensus and disagreements on critical topics of
interest. The three groups engaged were: IOM staff; representatives from
affected people and from civil society organizations at the local level;
and IOM local partners from the case studies. <sup>4</sup>

#### Online Survey … page 12

The survey was conducted alongside the FGDs and the KIIs. Its purpose
was to complement those other sources of information, primarily by
offering points for triangulation, especially in identifying trends
through the wider range of participants made possible by this method.
Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of the 214 survey respondents
across IOM administrative zones. Survey data eventually found limited
use in the evaluation due to issues with the formulation of the
questions. The results from the survey included in the main body of the
report are deemed as the most reliable ones, although their
interpretation is caveated.
