that their views were taken into account by IOM with regard to the
assistance they received, and 99 per cent reported that they felt well
informed about the assistance and services available. In addition, 97
per cent thought that they could channel their suggestion or lodge a
complaint if they had one, and 87 per cent of respondents reported that,
to their knowledge, suggestions and complaints raised were responded to.

Mainstreaming AAP into existing programmes is currently achieved through
ensuring that each project contributes a certain percentage of the costs
of a dedicated staff member and by allocating a specific percentage of
the budget from each project to cross-cutting issues, including AAP.
This strategy is a good practice that allows the MEAL team to
continuously conduct AAP activities. This approach ensures the
sustainability of key elements of IOM Ethiopia’s AAP approach, such as
the hotline and field staff capacity-building, as well as the ability to
respond to programmatic needs and requests. It is to be noted, however,
that hotline operators are not on staff contracts, which may jeopardize
their willingness to remain with the Organization.

AAP focal points in suboffices (existing staff members include roles
such as the WASH coordinator, the sexual and reproductive health
officer, and the protection associate, who are designated as focal
persons to oversee AAP initiatives on top of their “regular”
responsibilities) are also a key feature of IOM Ethiopia’s AAP approach.
These focal persons are chosen in consultation with the heads of
suboffices. This arrangement is deemed to be cost effective, as it does
not entail additional staff costs, while also yielding significant
benefits. The focal persons are able to conduct community, staff and
stakeholder training courses, contribute to AAP assessments, and
channel, refer and respond to complaints and feedback in line with the
expected standards. However, as the AAP-related tasks are added to the
focal points’ primary duties, their timely completion relies heavily on
available time and the readiness of staff themselves and their direct
management to dedicate time for AAP. No system is in place to formally
acknowledge achievements or address underperformance concerning
AAP-related tasks and responsibilities specifically.

In general, the mechanisms available for quality control of AAP
activities are insufficient. While the satisfaction of beneficiaries
with AAP mechanisms are verified in monitoring and evaluation surveys,
there are no “deeper” methods to verify the quality of the response in
place, such as recording of calls, or ad hoc verification of referral
effectiveness. AAP and CFM operators are not systematically trained in
all areas in which they may be required to respond, in order to be able
to respond appropriately to diverse beneficiaries and causes for
complaint; such areas can include PSEAH, child protection, response to
violence towards marginalized or vulnerable groups or psychological
first aid. The wellbeing of AAP and frontline staff who are responsible
for receiving feedback and complaints is also not systematically
monitored.

The strategy of assigning AAP responsibilities to staff in different
roles is also observed in interagency cooperation. MEAL and information
management officers from organizations like IOM, Plan International, and
OCHA are often responsible for CFM data management. This is deemed to be
efficient in terms of leveraging existing expertise and mainstreaming
AAP principles.
