areas of work (for instance integrated health-related issues) are not
well covered, and the application of AAP standards is variable. The
evaluation will also examine the status of the implementation of MOPAN
recommendations related to AAP and IASC commitments.

The evaluation will include a field-based analysis of IOM’s contribution
to regional and national initiativesand community-based approaches on
AAP, and of activities implemented as part of IASC task force and other
groups. It will also facilitate the identification of IOM’s comparative
advantage in system-wide strategic approaches and responses, and how
sustainability can be further enhanced.

The evaluation will triangulate evidence and select samples of programs
that can properly illustrate IOM’s contribution to the collective
commitment on AAP, to be used as case studies. The evaluation exercise
will not focus on the performance of individual programs per se.

The evaluation will also propose a Theory of Change (ToC) to illustrate
the expected changes that the AAP Framework will bring to IOM’s global
commitment in this area.

The target audience for this evaluation is IOM management, IOM staff
involved in institutional and operational implementation of AAP approach
at HQ and field levels, as well as interested donors, Member States, and
international and local partners.

### EVALUATION CRITERIA AND QUESTIONS … page 86

The evaluation will utilize the standard OECD/DAC criteria <sup>4</sup>
and integrate an analysis of IOM cross cutting themes of gender,
disability, environment and human rights-based approaches in the
strategic papers and guidance related to AAP<sup>5</sup>. The evaluation
will address the following main questions:

#### Relevance: … page 86

To what extent is IOM’s AAP approach relevant and aligned with the needs
and priorities of IOMMember States and UN System (IASC commitments in
particular), and of the affected populationsand beneficiaries IOM
assist?

Are IOM’s AAP mechanisms and guidance relevant for IOM offices to enable
programming and implementation of AAP in its interventions?

How does IOM’s AAP approach consider IOM cross-cutting issues of human
rights, gender equality, disability and environment?

To what extent were ‘relevant marginalized groups’ defined/identified by
rights-holders themselves? Are there institutional comparative
advantages for AAP approach, which can be identified in the
Organization’s mandate, to support further advancement in the fields of
AAP?

What mechanisms are in place to guarantee that the design and
implementation of IOM interventions address power dynamics between
affected populations and local and internationalentities?
