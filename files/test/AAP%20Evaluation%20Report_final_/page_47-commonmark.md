Informants highlighted some of the challenges pertaining to the
coherence of AAP in IOM Ethiopia. These include inconsistent CFM
mechanisms: the Zite Manager solution mentioned above is not used across
all programmes and functions and plans to expand its usage have not been
implemented due to a lack of resources. Some alternative programme- or
project-specific CFMs are in place, and their operation is not
necessarily coordinated with the work of the AAP focal persons. A second
challenge is that some complaints remain unanswered, either by IOM or by
implementing partners, sometimes because complaints may be challenging
to address, and other times because addressing them is beyond the
capacity or scope of IOM or its partners. An example of the latter is
the suspension of food aid by donors in 2023, which was beyond the
direct control or influence of IOM Ethiopia. A third challenge noted by
informants, this one with respect to the AAP focal persons, is that
sometimes AAP activities became secondary to other responsibilities due
to workload, directions received from supervisors, or the lack of
specific incentives to undertake AAP duties on top of “normal”
responsibilities. A fourth challenge observed by informants was the way
that some colleagues essentially intend AAP as mere CFM management,
without recognizing or engaging with the broader scope and depth of AAP
principles and approaches.

###### Inter-Agency Coherence and Coordination … page 47

The IAAWG was launched in 2009 by organizations seeking to improve
accountability processes. This initiative facilitates inter-agency
cooperation and coordination in Ethiopia. The terms of reference were
developed in 2013, followed by a memorandum of understanding in 2019.
The group operates with rotational leadership and is currently chaired
by IOM and cochaired by Plan International.

The primary objective of the working group was to achieve horizontal and
vertical harmonization among member agencies by standardizing AAP
frameworks, indicators and measurement methods. Over time, the working
group came to acknowledge that the diversity in AAP frameworks and
approaches among member organizations was a value rather than a
limitation, shifting its focus to sharing best practices through a
community of practice.

Standardized reporting tools for CFM data have been developed, albeit in
manual Microsoft Excel-based formats, with ongoing discussions on how to
automate the template for greater efficiency. The consolidated data are
analysed using Microsoft’s Power BI to produce the Community Voices
report, which is meant to inform planning and decision-making at cluster
and humanitarian country team levels. However, less than half of working
group members are actively engaging with this initiative.

Coordination with regard to AAP between IOM and other agencies in the
IDP camps settings, where IOM is responsible for CCCM, was also observed
to be in place. However, according to informants, only 60 to 70 per cent
of all complaints are answered: in some instances, complaints and
requests for services are be shared with CCCM staff by community
members, but either there is no service provider in the area able to
provide the requested service, or service providers present are unable
to respond to the complaints.
