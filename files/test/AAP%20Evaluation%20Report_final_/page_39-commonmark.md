Increasing the visibility of AAP activities should not be limited to
producing dedicated material; as well, general communications on IOM
interventions should highlight their AAP components and results.

For the follow-up to this recommendation, the following activities
should be considered:

- Conduct a comprehensive mapping of AAP activities and approaches, on
  which the identification of good practices can be based.
- Establish regular dissemination channels on AAP (such as newsletters,
  blogs and webinar series), with the specific intent of giving
  visibility to good practice and innovative initiatives.
- Promote the publication and dissemination of case studies on AAP,
  building on communities of practice and collaboration with other
  thematic and programme areas.
- Use communications to strengthen incentives for engagement in AAP,
  including prizes given to best initiatives, solutions and
  achievements.
- Strengthen current knowledge management practice in AAP.

Recommendation 7: The AAP team should increase training opportunities
and update capacitybuilding material with increased focus on practical
AAP implementation and including standard tools and templates, which
will have been developed in consultation with relevant field offices,
partners and community of practice members.

Informants overwhelmingly indicated that more practical guidance on AAP
is needed. Such guidance could include standard CFM SOPs, template
feedback forms, off-the-shelf CFM management systems and CFM data
analysis dashboards, all of which should be easily adapted to and
deployed in field contexts. Training material and capacity-building
resources should also be expanded accordingly and should place renewed
focus on practical AAP implementation. The training supply should also
be expanded, as demand is currently not fully met.

For the follow-up to this recommendation, the following activities
should be considered:

- Develop practical guidance material (such as a template and guidance
  for AAP datasharing agreements, CFM forms, etc.) based on the requests
  of field-level AAP focal persons and involving the AAP community of
  practice.
- Critically review current training methodology and identify ways in
  which training effectiveness can be enhanced, and in which the notions
  acquired can be put to practical use. This may include on-the-job
  training arrangements, training follow-ups, and peer review and
  engagement.
- Include AAP-related material in the current revision of the IOM
  Project Handbook to bridge the gap between policy and practice.
- Develop and conduct an AAP training-of-trainer initiative.

Recommendation 8: The AAP team should enhance and standardize CFM
systems used in IOM through the following actions:

- Map existing CFM systems.
