According to the RA Monitoring and Satisfaction surveys, 56% of the
surveyed returnees were satisfied or very satisfied with the
reintegration assistance support provided by the JI-HoA <sup>17</sup>.

Focus Group Discussions highlighted the importance of the economic
assistance to enable returnees to develop sources of income
(e.g. through start-up businesses or employment). Since returnees are
coming back usually “empty-handed”, they are experiencing shame, guilt,
and are stigmatised by their communities and relatives. The economic
support offered by the JI-HoA not only provides them with resources to
start their business but also restores their dignity and self-trust
<sup>18</sup>.

In the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), some returnees pointed out that
the overall value of the economic assistance was not enough.
<sup>19</sup> This was also confirmed by a stakeholder from Sudan, who
suggested that returnees needed more money to satisfy their livelihood
during the time of planting, growing and harvesting, since they put most
of the microbusiness support into the producing and often have no other
sources of income <sup>20</sup>. The microbusiness assistance did not
always correspond to the knowledge of the recipient or the local
context. Namely, a few of the returnees revealed that they were not
consulted or received different support than they selected, so they had
no other option, but just to accept the support <sup>21</sup>.

In terms of psychosocial needs, research results presented at the
Research and Evidence Facility (REF) conference of June 2022 indicated
that the incidence of Common Mental Disorders (CMD) is significantly
higher among JI-HoA beneficiaries in Ethiopia when compared with
non-migrant control group <sup>22</sup>. The high prevalence of CMD
among returned migrants from the Middle East was also found in another
study <sup>23</sup>. This indicates that irregular migrants are much
more affected by the CMD compared to people who do not migrate. The
specific focus of the JI-HoA on MHPSS therefore addresses key
difficulties faced by migrants.

However, in the execution, some gaps were found in the correspondence of
specific activities to returnees’ psychosocial needs. The JI-HoA
Programme’s Lessons Learned from the Psychosocial Support Component
Report noted gaps in the post-return psychosocial support (e.g., lack of
MHPSS service, unclear information about compensation of the treatment,
high cost, stigma, and low awareness about MHPSS needs among
communities) <sup>24</sup>. The post-return psychosocial support was not
wellintegrated into the main documents of the JI-HoA programme
<sup>25</sup>. This lack of attention led to the lack of
