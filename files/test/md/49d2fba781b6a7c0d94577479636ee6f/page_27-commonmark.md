The EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration in
the Horn of Africa was a unique effort to support return and
reintegration in a highly complex political and economic context. The
scope of the support provided (e.g. considering all dimensions of the
integrated approach) required extensive investment of resources by IOM
and stakeholders, but created valuable, even life-saving benefits for
beneficiaries.

Despite the challenges, the JI-HoA has created important results and
impact on the individual level. Desk research, interviews, and Focus
Group Discussions point out that the EU-IOM Joint Initiative has been of
crucial importance to address the needs of migrants and returnees facing
dire situations (including abuse, violence, and exploitation) in their
host countries.

Continuous contact between IOM and returnees ensured that returnees’
needs were identified and monitored from the moment of their
identification in the host/transit country. Extensive evidence was found
of efforts made by MRCs and IOM staff to identify vulnerabilities and
provide individualized support in terms of economic support, social
support, and psychosocial support.

Similarly, community-based reintegration projects were helpful in
creating business and employment opportunities (although their impact
was still affected by the overall economic decline) and various
community members noted this support as important factor reducing their
need to migrate for economic reasons. Additionally, CBR projects have
also shown clear value for social cohesion and reduction of stigmas
towards returnees, which in turn supported their reintegration. Various
examples were found regarding the link between social cohesion and
economic self-sufficiency of returnees.

Additionally, the JI-HoA has made important contributions to the
availability of data and research on migration trends in the region. The
impact in this regard is twofold. Firstly, stakeholders explicitly
appreciated the work of the Regional Data Hub in terms of data
production and capacity building. The dissemination and subsequent use
of data in decision-making can have a long-term positive impact on
return and reintegration, by providing governments and stakeholders with
tools and capacity to use these data in there policy- and
decision-making.

Secondly, the research done by the JI-HoA itself as part of its
monitoring and evaluation has provided important evidence for
programming. It allowed the IOM and its partners and stakeholders to
learn about the diverse needs of returnees, which needs can be
addressed, and what approaches are more or less effective. This
knowledge is of great importance to inform migrant protection, return
and reintegration programming in the region.
