as COVID-19, security issues and economic crises prevented them from
treating return migration as a priority throughout the implementation of
the JI-HoA. Before the implementation of the JI-HoA programme, in most
countries, there were limited frameworks or mechanism for migration,
governments had no tools, and no national capacity building strategies
which in turn led to limited capacity to facilitate return and
reintegration. The JI-HoA programme addressed this gap through capacity
building activities and tools such as the SOPs and various guidelines.
<sup>29</sup>

Interviews revealed that the efforts of the JI-HoA regarding migration
data were of particular relevance and importance to the stakeholders.
Namely, there was a clear lack of data on migration and existing tools
and methods to collect such data were not harmonized across the region.
Therefore, data between countries could not be compared. <sup>31</sup>

##### 4.1.2.2 Needs of other stakeholders … page 13

Generally, the interview analysis revealed that the needs of the other
national stakeholders were identified and addressed by the programme.
The survey of partners, presented in the Partnership Analysis assessment
that was conducted under the programme, showed that 82% of partners
believed IOM’s local capacity building activities were useful.
<sup>33</sup> The partnership analysis report concluded that the
differences between implementing partners (IPs) on “technical capacity,
work experience with international organisations, and reporting ability”
were prominent from the beginning of the programme. Therefore, IOM’s
training for IPs on various topics were necessary to mitigate these
differences <sup>33</sup>.

However, despite this support, some partners identified areas where the
programme could improve. Some of the IPs found the active guidance of
the IOM less relevant, as they perceived themselves as having more
experience and knowledge than the IOM<sup>34</sup> or that the capacity
building was not necessary since they already had enough capacity
<sup>35</sup>.
