In 2016, the EU and IOM launched the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant
Protection and Reintegration, with as overall objective “To contribute
to facilitating orderly, safe, regular and rights-based migration
through the facilitation of dignified voluntary return and the
implementation of development-focused and sustainable reintegration
policies and processes”. The EU-IOM Joint Initiative in the Horn of
Africa (JI-HOA) <sup>1</sup> commenced in March 2017 in the Khartoum
Process countries, with a focus on Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and
Sudan. <sup>2</sup> The programme was coordinated by a Regional
Coordination Unit (RCU) based in the IOM Regional Office for the East
and Horn of Africa region (Nairobi, Kenya).

In accordance with the programme planning, the JI-HoA underwent a
Mid-Term Evaluation in 2019 and a Final Independent Evaluation in
2022/2023, covering the 2017-2022 period, conducted by PPMI Group and
commissioned by IOM. The evaluation covered the four JI core countries
in the HoA, namely Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti, as well as the
RCU based in Kenya given regionally implemented and coordinated
activities, looking at all pillars of the Action (migration data;
capacity building; awareness raising; protection and voluntary assisted
return; and individual and communitybased reintegration).

The final evaluation assessed the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency,
coherence, and sustainability of the programme, with an eye on informing
future programming. To this end, the evaluation assessed the
achievements of the programme against its key objectives, including a
re-examination of the relevance of the objectives and of the design. It
also identified factors that have facilitated or impeded the achievement
of the objectives.

To gather the necessary data, the evaluation relied on desk research,
interviews with stakeholders, focus groups with beneficiaries, and a
validation workshop. Furthermore, a range of monitoring and evaluation
activities were already implemented under the JI-HoA. The results of
these M&E activities formed an important data source for the current
evaluation.

The current Report presents the findings of the evaluation against the
evaluation criteria and provides holistic conclusions and
recommendations to build on the achievements of the JI-HoA and improve
future programming.
