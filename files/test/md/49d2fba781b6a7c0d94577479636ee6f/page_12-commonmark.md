##### 4.1.1.3 Needs of community members … page 12

The interviews and the desk research analysis revealed that the
programme addressed many priorities of communities in terms of
reintegration and livelihoods support. One of the main drivers of
migration is the lack of economic opportunities to secure a livelihood,
combined with the prevailing perception that jobs are available
elsewhere. The creation of economic opportunities within the community
reduces the risk of social conflict (e.g. negative attitudes to
returnees who receive financial support as described above), while
simultaneously decreasing the drive to migrate out of economic necessity
among other community members.

According to the community participation survey administered to 1,232
community members (221 in Ethiopia, 745 in Somalia, and 266 in Sudan)
between November 2019 and July 2022, the majority of the respondents
believed that the community projects under the EU-IOM JI-HoA addressed
the needs of the community and of returnees. <sup>27</sup>

809 (476 male, 333 female) respondents.. The evaluation revealed that
not all targeted communities received the same support from the IOM
while implementing their projects. There were some communities where a
needs assessment was conducted with the local government and not
community members directly (which would take a large amount of time).
<sup>28</sup> As a result, some interviewees revealed that they “needed
to work on projects that were not based on our skills or that were more
beneficial to the government”. <sup>29</sup>

governments of participating countries were highly interested in the
JI-HoA and committed to its objectives although urgent problems such
