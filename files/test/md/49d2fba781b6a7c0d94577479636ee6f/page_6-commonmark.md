Source: IOM Reintegration Handbook As demonstrated in the figure above,
the integrated approach targets three societal levels <sup>6</sup> :

- Individual level: Initiatives to address the specific needs and
  vulnerabilities of returnees and returning family members.
  Reintegration support is provided to individual returnees, based on an
  assessment of their needs.
- Community level: Initiatives that respond to the needs,
  vulnerabilities, and concerns of communities to which migrants return,
  including returnee families and the non-migrant population.
- Structural/system level: Initiatives that promote good governance of
  migration through engagement with local and national authorities and
  stakeholders and supports continuity of assistance through adequate
  local public services.

Besides the three vertical levels, the integrated approach addresses
reintegration from three horizontal dimensions:
