for follow-up adjustments, noting how these may not necessarily apply to
an ongoing initiative but to future ones, and should therefore be
considered at the project development phase.

Figure 4. Assessment of IOM ability to use feedback from affected people
to change programme implementation and better assist affected people
![](img-4.jpeg) AI-generated image description: *** Bar chart showing
the distribution of program implementation levels and their effects on
affected people. The chart displays five categories: ‘Very high’ (18%,
blue bar), ‘High’ (25%, red bar), ‘Medium’ (32%, yellow/gold bar), ‘Low’
(18%, green bar), and ‘Very low’ (6%, orange bar). The y-axis shows
percentages from 0% to 35%, and each bar is labeled with its
corresponding percentage value. The ‘Medium’ category represents the
largest proportion at 32%, while ‘Very low’ represents the smallest at
6%. The chart appears to be measuring the impact or reach of some
program across different intensity levels. ***

Finding 3.3. There is a perceived gap between the rationale for
undertaking AAP and its practical implications for programming that, if
filled, can increase effectiveness.

IOM advocates internally for AAP through a human rights-based approach,
consistent with its global principles and values. Nevertheless, most
informants interviewed noted that the AAP Framework places limited
emphasis on how programme implementation can practically benefit from
the feedback received from affected people. As one of them stated,
“People have not realized the risk of not involving communities. It is
crucial to show results \[from involving affected people\], not just
principles. Explain to staff why they should do it.”

Several respondents suggested including more AAP-related material in the
next revision of the IOM Project Handbook, to bridge the gap between
policy and practice more effectively. It was suggested that such
integration should explicitly integrate AAP activities into the project
cycle. Moreover, some suggested making the link between AAP and risk
management stronger: affected people are often better positioned than
IOM to make practical decisions about programme activities (for example,
selecting playground locations, determining suitable livelihood options
in the local context and addressing educational access challenges) and
even when not, their input on these decisions is anyway essential to
avoid gross operational mistakes. In this sense, it was suggested that
the involvement of affected people can be framed also as a vital tool
for mitigating risks inherent in humanitarian and development
interventions.
