informants suggested that, with regard to IOM distribution activities,
consultations on distribution reach, quality and procedures with the
affected people improved the integrity of the distribution process.
These informants indicated that such AAP initiatives were taking place
in IOM Türkiye.

The notion that AAP can lead to improvements in programme design and
implementation, as well as to improved outcomes, was understood by most
individuals consulted. Numerous examples were provided of past or
ongoing initiatives to involve affected people in the project cycle,
with a strong emphasis on the inclusion of women and people with
disabilities. However, it was not always clear whether these initiatives
necessarily translated into significant changes; nor was it clear that
it fostered a sense of agency and empowerment among the individuals and
communities involved. <sup>21</sup>

At the field level, the evaluators came across initiatives supporting
self-governance structures and participation in camp activities.
Beneficiaries were encouraged to take on tasks related to on-site
management and daily routines, and to running relatively small-scale
projects. These initiatives were deemed as promising and relevant for
enhancing the impact of AAP.

### Sustainability … page 32

Evaluation questions and themes for the “sustainability” criterion:

- EQ19. Does IOM’s participation in the United Nations and IASC
  mechanisms facilitate access to funding and resource mobilization
  related to AAP?
- EQ24. What systems are in place to address and guarantee the
  sustainability of IOM’s application of AAP principles and commitments
  in its interventions?
- EQ25. Does IOM’s engagement with governments, civil society, the
  United Nations, IASC and affected populations facilitate the
  sustainability of IOM’s support and accountability?
- EQ26. Has IOM’s integration of AAP principles in its work helped to
  generate stable and long-lasting participation and accountability
  mechanisms for people from affected marginalized groups?

Finding 6.1: IN/285 constitutes a milestone achievement for
sustainability, as it provides a legal basis for the IOM commitment to
AAP. However, uneven leadership engagement and inadequate resourcing
risk making this commitment aspirational rather than real.

As part of the Grand Bargain and other international commitments, IOM
operates within a broader network of United Nations organizations and
donors advocating for investment in AAP. Informants saw that active
engagement in this environment was key to receiving dedicated funding
for the development of the IOM AAP Framework. <sup>22</sup> The release
of IN/285

\[^0\] \[^0\]: <sup>21</sup> Some results from the global survey also
suggested less than clear outcomes in this area. When staff were asked
if IOM activities had successfully enhanced the participation of
vulnerable populations in decision-making processes and whether they had
resulted in improved well-being and empowerment, results were mixed. See
Annex E for the full details on the survey results. <sup>22</sup> IOM
has received substantial and dedicated donor support for the development
of its AAP Framework, particularly from the United Kingdom Foreign,
Commonwealth and Development Office and the USAID Bureau for
Humanitarian Assistance. Informants also acknowledged the benefits
gained from engagement with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC)
while developing the institutional AAP Framework.
