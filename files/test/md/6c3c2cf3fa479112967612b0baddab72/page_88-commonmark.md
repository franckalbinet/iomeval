donors, UN partners and affected populations, including beneficiaries?

Did IOM’s investments in AAP institutionalization and programs lead to
immediate and mediumterm results and impacts that can be identified at
global, regional, and national levels?

Did IOM’s programs and projects have an impact on the representation and
meaningful participation of particularly vulnerable population groups
(i.e., women, girls, persons with disabilities) in decision-making
processes?

#### Sustainability … page 88

What systems are in place to address and guarantee the sustainability of
IOM’s application of AAP principles and commitments in its

### METHODOLOGY, ROLES, AND TIMEFRAME … page 88

The evaluation will be conducted by an external consultant(s) under the
guidance and responsibility of EVA. The main counterpart for the
evaluation is DHRRE/AAP, which will provide support during the conductof
evaluation and appoint members to the reference group (RG) for the
evaluation. EVA and DHRR will discuss during the inception phase the
opportunity of inviting other units/divisions to be part of the RG. The
RG will meet regularly (at the inception stage and during the conduct of
the exercise), share relevantdocumentation with the consultant(s), and
identify internal and external structures, processes, policies,
strategies, and programmatic approaches relevant for the successful
conduct of the evaluation. The RG will provide feedback on the
evaluation deliverables, i.e., the terms of reference, the inception
report, and the draft evaluation report. In consultation with EVA, the
RG will propose lists of key informants to be interviewed inside and
outside of IOM, and of survey(s)’ participants, which will then be
finalized in coordination with the consultant(s).

The methodology will apply mixed methods, including but not limited to
documentation review, structured and semi-structured interviews,
electronic surveys, selected case studies, evidence mapping, and
synthesis of IOM and other UN agency evaluations and research. The
document review should provideinsights into the level of integration of
AAP into IOM’s programme design, implementation and decision making, as
well as into the strengths and weaknesses of IOM’s approach.
Furthermore, the evaluation consultant(s) will analyze evaluations,
reviews and studies related to AAP from other international
organizations, including assessments covering IASC commitments, to make
some comparative analysis ofAAP integration in IOM.

The interviews will be carried out both in person and remotely (by
phone, MS Teams, electronically via email or through similar means). If
the recruited consultant(s) is(are) based in Geneva, face-to-face
interviews may be considered with HQ staff. Interviewees’ input will be
fully confidential. EVA will discussthe conduct of electronic surveys
with RG and finalize the survey
