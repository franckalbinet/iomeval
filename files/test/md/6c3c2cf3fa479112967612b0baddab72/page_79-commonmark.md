![](img-12.jpeg) AI-generated image description: *** This is a survey or
assessment table with a rating scale structure. The table has a blue
header row with ‘Question’ on the left and numbered columns 1-5 on the
right, plus two additional columns labeled ‘I don’t know/Not
applicable’. The left column contains five questions related to
Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP): 1) Senior leadership
support to AAP, 2) Donor support to AAP, 3) Participatory mechanisms in
place at IOM’s field operations (both in emergency and development
contexts), 4) External partners’ support for APP in IOM, and 5)
Visibility of IOM’s work on AAP for external partners. The table appears
to be a Likert-scale assessment tool where respondents would rate each
question on a scale of 1-5, with an option to indicate if they don’t
know or if the question is not applicable. ***

![](img-13.jpeg) AI-generated image description: *** Pie chart showing
regional distribution percentages. The chart displays data for multiple
regions: East Asia (23.8%, largest segment in blue), Middle East (17.3%,
red segment), South (10.7%, yellow segment), Headquarters (10.7%, green
segment), Asia and Pacific (9.8%, orange segment), Central (8.0%, cyan
segment), Central (8.4%, light blue segment), South America (3.7%,
smaller light blue segment), Southern (3.1%, pink/salmon segment), and
Europe (3.3%, yellow segment). The chart uses distinct colors for each
segment and includes percentage labels for each region, providing a
clear visual representation of proportional distribution across
geographic areas. ***

![](img-14.jpeg) AI-generated image description: *** Pie chart showing
the distribution of responses across different office types, with
accompanying data table. The chart displays five categories: Country
Office (68.22%, shown in blue, occupying the majority of the pie),
Regional Office (14.49%, shown in red), HQ (9.81%, shown in yellow),
Other (6.54%, shown in green), and Administrative centers (0.93%, shown
in a small orange slice). The left side shows a table with the same
categories and percentages. Total valid responses are 214. The
visualization clearly demonstrates that Country Office represents more
than two-thirds of all responses, while Administrative centers represent
less than 1%. ***
