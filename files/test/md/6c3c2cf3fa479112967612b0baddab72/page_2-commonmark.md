This report outlines the background, findings, and recommendations
resulting from an evaluation of IOM accountability to affected
populations (AAP), carried out by Nike Consultoria Ltda on behalf of the
IOM Central Evaluation Division (CED), the Office of Internal Oversight
(OIO). The team of consultants was led by Team Leader Melissa Andrade
Costa, and included Mehiret Habte, who oversaw the Ethiopian case study.

Both the IOM CED and the consultants would like to extend their sincere
gratitude and appreciation to all those who contributed valuable time
and insights to the evaluation, including the representatives of donors,
UN agencies, international NGOs, and IOM staff and managers at all
levels of the Organization.

Special appreciation is extended to IOM AAP staff and managers for their
thoughtful reflections, and to the contributors for the two case studies
from Ethiopia and Türkiye, both conducted in person.

Final responsibility for the overall conclusions and the recommendation
in this report lies with the IOM CED.
