of monitoring and evaluation functions in the context of cross-border
operations was to confirm that no “red flags” were raised during the
implementation of the activities, allowing for the release of payment to
implementing partners.

four quadrants showing a monitoring and accountability system. The
circle is split by a vertical and horizontal line creating four
sections. The top half contains ‘Tracking of assistance’ (left) and
‘Third Party Monitoring’ (right). The bottom half shows ‘Endorsement’
(left) and ‘Accountability to Affected Populations’ (right). Four gray
boxes surround the circle at the cardinal points, connected by arrows:
‘Risk Mitigation’ (top-left), ‘Quantitative and Qualitative’
(top-right), ‘Complaints and feedback mechanism’ (bottom-right), and an
unlabeled box (bottom-left). The diagram illustrates an integrated
approach to program monitoring, combining different monitoring methods
with accountability mechanisms and risk management components. ***

*** Bar chart showing feedback/complaint distribution per IP (IP1-IP7).
Each IP has two bars - blue bars representing ‘Expressions of gratitude’
and green bars representing ‘Confirmed receipt of assistance’. Values
range from 272-549 for blue bars and 354-549 for green bars. Below each
IP pair are numerical breakdowns for different feedback categories:
‘Issues with quality and quantity’ (orange), ‘Request to receive same
assistance again/for longer time’ (yellow), ‘Requests for another type
of assistance’ (tan), and ‘Other issues’ (gray). IP1 shows highest
values (504/549), while IP6 shows lowest (272/354). Source cited as DIPS
report November 2023. ***

Data were also collected for post-assistance monitoring purposes in the
context of the refugee response programme. The team in charge of these
cross-border operations had set up a multilingual hotline and developed
a dedicated CFM application to track the calls and manage different
types of requests received.

The two CFMs worked independently and were designed as different
solutions for different programmes, with no evident attempt to explore
synergies.
