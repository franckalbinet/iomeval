Evaluation questions and themes for the “efficiency” criterion:

- EQ10. What systems are in place to collect and integrate the views of
  affected populations in IOM’s work?
- EQ17. Are IOM’s resource allocations appropriate to support IOM
  institutionalization and operationalization of AAP approach and
  related evolving international requirements? Are the specific
  resources allocated to AAP managed efficiently?
- EQ18. Are the systems in place to support IOM offices in fundraising
  for AAP interventions efficient, adaptive, and cost-effective?
- EQ20. Is IOM efficient in supporting and enhancing staff expertise and
  development in the field of AAP?

Finding 4.1 The amount of resourcing allocated to AAP is inadequate to
pursue institutional objectives, and the funding of AAP is not
approached in strategic terms. The size of the AAP unit in IOM
Headquarters increased but remained modest for the workload.

IOM was found to have implemented a large number of systems for
collecting data from affected people. The decentralized structure of IOM
was widely recognized by informants as conducive to tailoring AAP
approaches to different operational and cultural contexts. Discussions
of the diversity of tools used to engage affected people (including SMS,
WhatsApp, social media, house visits, complaints boxes, hotlines, calls,
surveys, focus group discussions and community engagement projects)
emphasized the adaptability of IOM, particularly in challenging
environments.

At the same time, informants interviewed for this evaluation
overwhelmingly felt that the resources currently allocated to AAP in IOM
Headquarters are insufficient to meet the demand for support and
learning coming from country offices, as well as to drive the
development or expansion of relevant guidance and resources. Some
informants were frustrated by the absence of an overall funding strategy
for AAP to support central AAP structures, noting how advancements often
overly relied on the dedication of staffers instead of a structured and
sustainable approach. At the country level, informants noted the way
that funding for AAP functions often depends entirely on a single
project-specific budget, with limited to no use of the (scarce) core
resources available to country or regional offices, and rare cases of
pooling resources proportionally from different projects (see Case study
IOM Ethiopia for an example).

The size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters has expanded over time,
though it clearly remains disproportionately small when considering the
size of the Organization, as well as the fact that AAP is a mandatory
aspect of the work of IOM since the formalization of the AAP Framework
into IN/285. At the time of writing these findings, only one full-time
staffer was
