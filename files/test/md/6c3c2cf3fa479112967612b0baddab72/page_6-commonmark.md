This external evaluation assessed whether or not IOM is delivering on
its commitments to accountability to affected populations (AAP),
<sup>1</sup> following findings from the 2023 MOPAN assessment
indicating that the Organization has not yet been able to consistently
incorporate AAP across all its programmes, and did not invest adequately
in AAP, considering the scale of its operations. In addition to a review
of both internal and public documents related to AAP, data collection
methods included consultations with a relatively large number of
individuals (IOM staff members, predominantly), through key informant
interviews (KIIs), focus group discussions (FGDs) and an online survey.
The findings mainly reflect the perceptions of the individuals
consulted, rather than being based on technical assessments of specific
aspects of AAP work, as these were beyond the scope of this evaluation.

The main object of analysis was the overall IOM AAP Framework
(constituted by Instruction 285 (IN/285) and the body of guidance and
resources available to guide and support AAP activities) and the
activities implemented by the AAP Coordination Unit in Headquarters to
implement the AAP policy. AAP activities implemented at a country office
level were not systematically reviewed, except for two case studies on
AAP implementation, in IOM Ethiopia and IOM Türkiye. Findings on
decentralized activities are therefore based on these two case studies
and from the examples provided by the individuals consulted, which
combined form a partial representation of decentralized AAP
implementation in IOM.

The key findings of the evaluation are:

- The IOM AAP Framework is highly relevant, generally coherent and
  solidly centred around Instruction 285, with the caveat that its focus
  on emergency operations leaves many unclear on the mandatory nature of
  AAP in non-emergency contexts, where AAP principles are felt as
  equally applicable and where AAP-related activities are already being
  implemented.
- Resources allocated to central AAP functions remain inadequate. The
  AAP Coordination Unit is largely funded with earmarked funds and
  staffed by ungraded staff or consultants. Resources available are
  generally deemed to be insufficient to meet the demand for learning
  and to proactively support IOM country offices. Informants
  overwhelmingly indicated that more practical resources and hands-on
  support are needed for effective and efficient AAP implementation at
  the field level.
- There is no formal strategy, plan, or monitoring and evaluation
  framework to guide the implementation of AAP from a central level. AAP
  is currently monitored through a collection of indicators included in
  the IOM Strategic Result Framework and its related plan. These
  indicators have recorded significant growth in recent years, but they
  are not assessed against clear targets, they focus on outputs and very
  broadly defined outcomes, and they do not collectively constitute a
  robust policy monitoring

\[^0\] \[^0\]: <sup>1</sup> IOM follows the IASC definition of AAP,
which describes AAP as “an active commitment to use power responsibly by
taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the
people humanitarian organisations seek to assist” (IASC, 2015).
