affected populations for regional and local programming ![](img-3.jpeg)
AI-generated image description: *** Horizontal stacked bar chart showing
survey responses about four aspects of AAP (Age-friendly Action Plan)
implementation within IOM (International Organization for Migration).
The chart displays percentage distributions across five response
categories: ‘I don’t know’ (dark red), ‘Very high’ (blue), ‘High’
(cyan), ‘Moderate’ (orange), ‘Low’ (green), and ‘Very low’ (yellow). The
four measured aspects are: 1) Utility of IOM guidance on AAP to
establish partnerships and implement joint programmes (highest response:
34% High), 2) Communication of AAP Framework and tools within IOM
(highest response: 40% High), 3) Connection to cross-cutting issues of
human rights, gender equality, disability, and environment (highest
response: 30% High), and 4) Utility of AAP guidance and tools to help
with programming at regional and local level (highest response: 33%
High). Each bar shows the complete distribution of responses with
percentages labeled. The chart indicates generally positive perceptions
with ‘High’ and ‘Moderate’ responses being most common across all
categories. ***

At the time of this report, IOM had not yet established a dedicated
results matrix or theory of change to serve as an all-encompassing
system to set targets and track progress in implementing the AAP
Framework within the Organization. However, AAP is included in the
Organization’s Strategic Plan 2024-2028, in the objectives and
cross-cutting priorities of the accompanying SRF: <sup>10</sup>

- Two AAP-related indicators are included in the cross-cutting priority
  “integrity, transparency and accountability”:
- C1.8: “Number of IOM missions engaged in crisis-related programming
  integrating AAP into country strategic plans”;
- C1.9: “Number of IOM missions engaged in country’s inter-agency AAP
  working group”.
- One AAP-related indicator is included in the cross-cutting priority
  “protection-centred approaches”:
- C3.4: “Percentage of projects integrating AAP operational pillars into
  their activities”.

AAP is included as well within two of the three strategic objectives of
IOM:

- Objective 1. “Saving lives and protecting people on the move”:
