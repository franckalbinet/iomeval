Many informants credited the dedication and proactivity of the small AAP
team in IOM Headquarters in establishing learning mechanisms such as the
AAP community of practice and the online repository, as well as in
conducting global trainings. However, some informants felt that the
demand for learning was still, to a significant extent, unmet. Most IOM
staff interviewed valued the in-person AAP training sessions, feeling
that these sessions helped them recognize the importance of integrating
AAP into their programmes and daily practices. However, they also
frequently expressed a need for more practical training and follow-up,
sometimes indicating that conducting AAP training-of-trainers would be a
possible solution.

Figure 6. The perceived utility of the community of practice and the
online repository ![](img-6.jpeg) AI-generated image description: *** A
grouped bar chart comparing three categories related to AAP
(Accountability Action Plan) across six rating levels. The three
categories are: ‘Community of practice on AAP’ (12% not available, 17%
very high, 23% high, 18% moderate, 15% low, 16% very low), ‘Online
repository of AAP available for IOM Staff’ (21% not available, 17% very
high, 25% high, 22% moderate, 9% low, 7% very low), and ‘Training
provided by Headquarters on AAP to increase capacity in the area’ (17%
not available, 18% very high, 22% high, 19% moderate, 13% low, 10% very
low). The chart uses six different colored bars (blue for ‘Not
available’, red for ‘Very high’, yellow for ‘High’, green for
‘Moderate’, orange for ‘Low’, and cyan for ‘Very low’) to represent the
distribution of responses. The y-axis shows percentages from 0% to 30%.

Source: Evaluation survey. Concerning perceptions of the AAP community
of practice and the online repository, survey data regarding the utility
of these tools appear mixed, especially with regard to the community of
practice (Figure 6), with some informants suggesting that more promotion
and incentives for engagement would be needed to make the community more
active and relevant.

Finding 4.3. Guidance and resources are missing for efficient CFM
development and management, leading to duplication of effort, reduced
relevance and reduced impact of the analyses produced.

The lack of guidance and resources for CFM implementation and management
(which could potentially range from simple form “templates” to dedicated
software applications with multiple functions) was frequently mentioned
by informants, especially those based in country offices. In particular,
this gap was perceived as severely affecting efficiency, such as through
loss of information or duplication of effort. The picture emerging from
the different inputs on CFMs is one of fragmentation, where different
systems and tools have been developed in
