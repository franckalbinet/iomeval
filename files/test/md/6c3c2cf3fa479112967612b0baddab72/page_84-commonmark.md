### EVALUATION CONTEXT … page 82

Accountability to affected populations (AAP), initially referred to as
“accountability to beneficiaries”, considers affected populations as
partners rather than passive recipients of an assistance, aiming to
remove the power disparity between aid providers and the communities
they serve, for the purpose of ensuring the rights and dignity of the
affected populations and preventing the abuse of power and
sexualexploitation. Since the early 1990s, international humanitarian
actors have been strengthening the accountability to affected
populations by investing in the development and implementation of
principles, norms, policies, guidance, and training. The Humanitarian
Reform that followed the 2005 Humanitarian Response Review, and later
the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) Transformative Agenda (2011),
placed a strong focus on accountability to and protection of affected
populations, including refugees, migrants and internally displaced.

In 2012, the IASC Principals endorsed 5 commitments <sup>1</sup> on AAP
and collectively agreed to apply these principles in their
organizations, and to promote them in clusters and with partners. The
revised version of commitments has been endorsed by IASC Principals in
2017<sup>2</sup> to reflect developments such as the Core Humanitarian
Standard, the work done by the IASC on Inter-Agency community-based
complaints mechanism, including protection against sexual exploitation
and abuse (PSEA), and the importance of fostering meaningful
collaboration with local stakeholders. These developments resulted in a
range of collective and individual institutional commitments to include
people receiving aid in making the decisionsthat affect their lives and
provision of PSEA, which came out as priority recommendations from the
World Humanitarian Summit (2016) (WHS) and the Grand Bargain (2016).

Commitments emanating from the 2016 WHS highlighted actions for
furthering accountability to people affected by crises, safeguarding
humanity, empowering women as change agents and leaders, protecting
civilians, and increasing efforts by the international community to
support effective policies and frameworks that reduce new and protracted
situations of international and internal displacements in a safe and
dignified manner. The UN High-Level Summit for Refugees and Migrants in
2016 resulted in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants,
which paved the way for the adoption of two global

\[^0\] \[^0\]: <sup>1</sup> Leadership/governance; transparency;
feedback and complaints; participation; and design, monitoring, and
evaluation. <sup>2</sup> Leadership; participation and partnership;
information, feedback, and action; and results.
