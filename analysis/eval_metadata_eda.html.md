# IOM Reports Exploration


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## 1. Introduction

This exploratory analysis examines the metadata from IOM’s evaluation
repository as a preliminary step before mapping reports to strategic
frameworks like the Strategic Results Framework (SRF) and Global Compact
for Migration (GCM).

This EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) helps us understand the structure,
coverage, and characteristics of available evaluation reports before
using the `iomeval` package to create evidence maps that tag reports
against framework components. These maps will serve as knowledge
management tools, making it easier to identify relevant sources, spot
coverage gaps, and determine where synthesis reports would be valuable.

The repository includes various document types, from full evaluation
reports to management responses and annexes.
