FIGURE 5. LEVEL OF SATISFACTION WITH REINTEGRATION SUPPORT
![](img-5.jpeg)

Source: Reintegration Assistance (RA) Monitoring Survey (
*n* = 2, 928; 2, 591 male, 337 female) The majority of returnees were
satisfied with the support received. Some returnees indicated that the
economic support was crucial for them as they returned “with nothing”.
The support helped them to start a business or search for employment and
helped them create new social networks. <sup>89</sup> The majority of
FGD participants in Sudan were satisfied with medical, psychosocial
support, and social support. <sup>70</sup>

Focus Groups with returnees demonstrate that the main factors causing
dissatisfaction related to the insufficiency of economic support.
<sup>71</sup> For example, several Somalian returnees believed that the
economic support was too little. Similarly, a FGD in Sudan concluded
that “the total budget allocated to the income generation projects is
not sufficient to start projects/generate income to support a family.”72
The Year 4 Interim Report noted in this regard the adverse impact of
devaluation and difference between the official and “black market”
exchange rates in Sudan in 2021 which brought down the pre-2021 average.

Additionally, 54 community-based reintegration projects were initiated.
These projects have supported approximately 76,348 community and
returnee beneficiaries. <sup>73</sup> Itad’s “Spot Analytical Report \#1
-Community-based Reintegration Projects (CBRPs)” study found that the
majority of the CBR projects were well-designed with plausible outcomes,
focusing mainly on capacity building and livelihood support.
