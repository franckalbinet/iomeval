economic reintegration. As mentioned above, many returnees were glad to
receive economic assistance, but deemed it too little to become
economically reintegrated. <sup>83</sup>

At the same time, community members who attended the FGDs noted that CBR
projects contributed positively to economic and employment opportunities
in the community. 92% of surveyed community members reported that they
feel involved in the identification, design and/or implementation of
community-based reintegration, exceeding the 70% target.

Sustainability of reintegration … page 23

Besides the extent of economic, social, and psychosocial reintegration
of returnees as a result of the JIHoA intervention, the IMPACT study
also measured the sustainability of reintegration. The IMPACT study was
the first impact evaluation to use IOM’s metric of sustainable
reintegration, the Reintegration Sustainability Index (RSI). The RSI was
further adjusted based on literature reviews, which resulted in an
enhanced version of the institutional questionnaire, called RSS+.
<sup>84</sup>

However, the methodology to assess the sustainability of reintegration
is rather new and still subject to testing and improvement. Therefore,
adjustments in measuring reintegration sustainability were made during
the IMPACT study, considering the score threshold. The outcome of the
RSS against the Reintegration Sustainability Score shows that a large
difference exists between the use of the 0.5 and the 0.66 threshold.
Using the former approach, 92% of the respondents recorded a score
higher than the 0.5 threshold. Using the 0.66 threshold, only 53% of the
respondents would be considered as having attained “sufficient levels of
economic self-sufficiency, social stability and psychosocial wellbeing
in their community of return”.

#### 4.3.4. Functioning of the Integrated Approach … page 23

Based on the combined information gathered from desk research,
interviews and Focus Group Discussions, and the assessment of the
results achieved, the evaluation can conclude that the integrated
approach itself is of great importance to sustainable reintegration.
However, factors external to the JI hindered the integrated approach
from being effectively implemented at all levels.

Stakeholders noted, in particular, the combination of individual
reintegration support and CBR projects, aimed to create better cohesion
in communities and enable communities to support the reintegration
process. Interviews and focus groups conducted for this evaluation also
noted that
