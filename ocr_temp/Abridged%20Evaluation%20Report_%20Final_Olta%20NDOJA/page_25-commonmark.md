due to the urgency caused by the crisis in Libya, <sup>85</sup> the
top-up system was also necessary to widen the scope of the JI-HoA over
time. On the other hand, the top-up budgeting system created
uncertainties regarding the implementation budget, which hindered
planning and budgeting.

Based on the evaluated material, the human resources were mostly
sufficient to meet the programme objectives. The Mid-term Review of the
programme stated that there were staff shortages in the JI, and that
staff among MRCs was not always distributed efficiently. <sup>86</sup>
However, the present evaluation found that improvements were made in the
following years to ensure more available and more qualified staff to the
programme. There were only a few limitations mentioned in interviews.

Although there were delays in some activities, almost all final results
were met by the end of the implementation period of the programme. Note
that the initial timeline was amended several times in the course of
budget expansion. Beyond financial problems, and the lack of the
inception planning, security issues were the major - and most
important - reason for delays in Horn of Africa. The security risks
remained high for the whole region at the time of the JI-HoA programme
and showed a deteriorating trend. <sup>87</sup>

#### 4.4.2. Cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the programme … page 25

Based on the evaluated materials and the self-assessment of JI-HoA
employees, the programme was cost-effective overall, and it also
increased the efficiency of some services despite challenges with
resource management. As there were not enough resources provided to
precisely estimate the distribution of the budget and staff, the
following conclusions rest on estimations.

Some assistance activities for beneficiaries became more efficient
during the programme implementation. According to surveys, the return
arrangements were better organized, and it became easier to get in touch
with IOM for the application of return procedures. The time taken from
return to receiving reintegration assistance also decreased, there were
less people who had to wait seven or more months in later years.
However, the waiting time for the response on return application
fluctuated during the implementation. The delays in services could have
been due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the instable security
situation. The war in Tigray region in Northern Ethiopia broke out in
2020, which affected the capacity of the state of Ethiopia to support
their citizens to return home.

Based on the evaluated material it can be concluded that although the
JI-HoA was effective in forming partnerships with service providers,
additional measures are needed to ensure the stability and financial
independence of these actors to increase the efficiency gains created.
To decrease costs, partners were expected to complement JI-HoA services
without any support or to take over activities and become
self-sustaining. However, lack of resources, unstable states, government
turnover and the lack of service providers in certain regions made the
full reliance on partnerships impossible.

National referral systems were established in all countries, but they
did not become fully effective and sustainable. This was mainly due to
the lack of independent capacity in the region. The effective
functioning of referral systems would have enabled IOM to hand over more
services to state
