The complexity of the JI-HoA and the integrated approach, and the
fragility of existing systems in the Horn of Africa countries, leads to
the conclusion that ownership and sustainability of the programme cannot
be expected after five years of implementation. Important progress has
been made, but continued support is needed in terms of
capacity-building, but also for wider socio-economic development and
security in the four countries in general.

Namely, the vast majority of challenges and barriers to the achievements
of the JI-HoA are linked to the context in which it takes place, and to
external factors. Capacity-building efforts were undermined by political
priorities and staff turnover; referral systems and service provision
for migrants and returnees were hindered by a lack of a structure
national referral mechanism, well-functioning health and social security
systems, and economic support lost value in the face of a deteriorating
economic situation and inflation. Activities of the JI were furthermore
hindered by civil conflict and security issues. Therefore, the situation
of returnees cannot be addressed without simultaneously addressing the
wider socio-economic context.

### 5.2. Recommendations … page 28

Based on the conclusions of the evaluation, the evaluation team has
designed the following recommendations towards migrant protection,
return and reintegration programming.

1.  Enhance efforts with national, regional, and local stakeholders to
    build capacity and ownership (while continuing provision of
    funding).

The EU-IOM Joint Initiative has put visible effort in building the
capacity of national actors to support return and reintegration.
However, political priorities did not always ensure ownership and
commitment of governments to take the JI results forward. Additionally,
turnover of staff has removed trained staff and therefore undone some of
the work of the JI in this regard.

Two important steps need to be taken to enhance the capacity and
ownership of key stakeholders, which would set the scene for
sustainability and impact. Firstly, capacity building should be expanded
to a wider scope of persons. This should include the entire relevant
organisational departments, ensuring the participation of top and middle
management as well as their staff.

Secondly, capacity alone is not sufficient to ensure impact and
sustainability of the work on return and reintegration. Therefore,
migrant protection, return and reintegration programming should focus
also on enhancing ownership and commitment of stakeholders towards these
topics. Possible steps include the gradual integration of MRCs with the
relevant public sector organizations, or coownership/management of the
MRCs by local governments (along with IOM) where some of the employees
are funded by the local government. In addition, the migrant protection,
return and reintegration programming should continue to support the
integration of return and reintegration into policy documents and
development plans

However, sustainability and independent work by governments and
stakeholders is not something that should be expected in the near
future. Therefore, financial resources from donors will still need to be
allocated to governments and stakeholders to implement their policies
and services for returnees.
