Evaluation questions and themes for the “impact” criterion:
<sup>19</sup>

- EQ21. How is IOM’s impact in the field of AAP perceived by IOM Member
  States, donors, United Nations partners and affected populations,
  including beneficiaries?
- EQ22. Did IOM’s investments in AAP institutionalization and programmes
  lead to immediate and medium-term results and impacts that can be
  identified at global, regional, and national levels?
- EQ23. Did IOM’s programmes and projects have an impact on the
  representation and meaningful participation of particularly vulnerable
  population groups (i.e., women, girls, persons with disabilities) in
  decision making processes?

#### Finding 5.1. While assessing impact is impossible at this stage, there are positive signs of increased involvement and engagement that might be attributable to AAP initiatives. … page 31

During the course of this evaluation, several examples were gathered of
AAP being effectively implemented in different operational contexts. IOM
piloted the AAP Framework in Türkiye (see Case study 2), South Sudan and
Nigeria. Noteworthy AAP practices have also been reported in Bangladesh
(IOM, 2021c), Ethiopia (see Case study 1), Ukraine, the Response for
Venezuela, Pakistan, Iraq and Somalia. In Ukraine, IOM developed several
online consultation mechanisms to better reach mobile populations. In
the Republic of Moldova, IOM has established a Telegram channel and has
appointed a dedicated AAP officer to manage community engagements,
trainings and hotlines, and to ensure the efficacy of the overall
approach. <sup>20</sup> In Ethiopia, a comprehensive AAP approach was
developed, covering different functional and programmatic areas of the
office. A common thread of the examples gathered was a strong leadership
engagement, innovation and, in some cases, an expanded conception of AAP
that included, for instance, actions to help increase the self-esteem of
affected individuals (IOM, 2021c).

Examples were also gathered of how engaging with affected people led to
changes. In Ethiopia, it emerged that only men had access to short-term,
unskilled or semi-skilled jobs (such as shelter maintenance, drainage
system and water tanker installation) with partners in the camps: women
within the committees advocated for equal job opportunities and this led
to an increase in their participation in such roles. Also in Ethiopia,
the design of shelters was modified based on women’s needs and
preferences. Discussions highlighted the significance of common
shelters, preferred by women as offering a better sense of safety.
Concerns regarding sanitation were also resolved through open dialogues
in various sessions. Some

Telegram channel. According to the IOM situation report from Moldova for
October-December 2023, “IOM continues to mainstream AAP through online
information sessions, a toll-free call centre and community information
centres, offering comprehensive information on IOM project activities,
available support and acting as a platform for receiving complaints,
feedback, and referrals. In November \[2023\], an information session
hosted on IOM Moldova’s Telegram channel, with over 1,000 members,
addressed 39 questions about IOM’s assistance. The toll-free call centre
at 080010877 continues to serve as the primary channel for referrals,
feedback, and complaints. Throughout the reporting period, a total of
1,433 calls were received, with most inquiries focusing on rental
assistance, cash assistance, and legal support” (IOM, 2023e:6).
