such as safety, gravelling of the land to prevent flooding, and communal
use activities. IOM is following up with community groups, trying to
monitor financial aspects and giving information sessions to inform
about specific risks (for example, providing basic information on the
proper use of fire extinguishers, communal light, and traffic safety).
In the words of a staff member, “I believe community committees
established, trained, and supported by IOM projects are good community
systems that will ensure continued AAP beyond closure of IOM projects.
Resources and capacity development need to be allocated for these
committees to build their capacities and be able to continue their roles
beyond projects.” Although community committees are distinct from
community-led projects, they have overlapping benefits in that they are
both examples of sustainable participation mechanisms which empower
communities and help secure the future sustainability of the support
provided by IOM.

#### Lessons Learned … page 59

- Senior management support was crucial to initiate AAP in IOM Türkiye.
  In particular, early senior management support was crucial to help set
  up the AAP mechanisms for cross-border operations.
- Training courses on AAP were key for governmental buy-in on AAP.
  Training government partners in Ankara on AAP was key to secure
  support and buy-in for AAP initiatives and to create awareness of the
  importance of consulting communities, especially in terms of the
  potential for learning and adaptation.

#### Recommendations … page 59

1.  Develop an integrated AAP strategy for the IOM Türkiye Country
    Office as a whole, rather than a separate one for each programme.
    Place the responsibility for AAP within the programme supervision
    unit in collaboration with those responsible for monitoring and
    evaluation, and develop an office-wide strategy for IOM Türkiye,
    integrating the different tools for enhanced efficiency.
2.  Increase coordination on AAP with other United Nations agencies and
    other relevant actors to foster collective accountability. Join
    efforts for collective accountability in Gaziantep and in Ankara or
    set up coordination for AAP when these are not available. Assess
    respondent fatigue and duplication in data collection to solve these
    issues as a priority.
3.  Invest more in community-led programmes. Change the approach from
    “what do you need?” to “what can we do together to improve?” Plan
    AAP initiatives with sustainability and empowerment in mind as
    opposed to only consultation on needs. Ask different questions that
    do not focus on needs but also on the possible contribution of
    affected people to change their lives and collaborate with IOM and
    other United Nations agencies.
4.  Improve in managing the expectations of affected people, while also
    making them more aware of the services available (such as the
    hotline). The AAP consultations were sometimes deemed to have led to
    increased expectations, which were then left unmet. Information and
    consultation protocols should be reviewed to better manage
