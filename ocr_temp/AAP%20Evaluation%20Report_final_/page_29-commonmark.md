Many informants credited the dedication and proactivity of the small AAP
team in IOM Headquarters in establishing learning mechanisms such as the
AAP community of practice and the online repository, as well as in
conducting global trainings. However, some informants felt that the
demand for learning was still, to a significant extent, unmet. Most IOM
staff interviewed valued the in-person AAP training sessions, feeling
that these sessions helped them recognize the importance of integrating
AAP into their programmes and daily practices. However, they also
frequently expressed a need for more practical training and follow-up,
sometimes indicating that conducting AAP training-of-trainers would be a
possible solution.

Source: Evaluation survey. Concerning perceptions of the AAP community
of practice and the online repository, survey data regarding the utility
of these tools appear mixed, especially with regard to the community of
practice (Figure 6), with some informants suggesting that more promotion
and incentives for engagement would be needed to make the community more
active and relevant.

Finding 4.3. Guidance and resources are missing for efficient CFM
development and management, leading to duplication of effort, reduced
relevance and reduced impact of the analyses produced.

The lack of guidance and resources for CFM implementation and management
(which could potentially range from simple form “templates” to dedicated
software applications with multiple functions) was frequently mentioned
by informants, especially those based in country offices. In particular,
this gap was perceived as severely affecting efficiency, such as through
loss of information or duplication of effort. The picture emerging from
the different inputs on CFMs is one of fragmentation, where different
systems and tools have been developed in
