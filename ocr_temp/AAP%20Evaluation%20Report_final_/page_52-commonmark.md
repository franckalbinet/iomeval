Activities that aim to raise the awareness of community members on
entitlements and rights, and to increase the direct involvement of
community members and structures in AAP activities, are important to
make humanitarian and development actors more accountable. Activities
such as training a community committee to disseminate information,
collect and convey feedback, or verify targeted beneficiaries have been
observed to lead to positive feedback about IOM responsiveness to the
community’s needs, and to mitigate risks such as aid diversion. The
development of AAP guidance, SOPs and other key documents benefited
greatly from participatory processes with field colleagues. For example,
the SOPs for the integration of AAP and PSEAH in cash and in-kind
interventions were discussed, amended and validated during a full day
workshop with the AAP focal points from the different suboffices, to
ensure they are operational and adapted to field offices’ capacities and
contexts. This process was deemed to have improved the quality of the
final document and facilitated buy-in from the colleagues expected to
implement those SOPs.

#### Recommendations … page 52

1.  Define a comprehensive monitoring framework for AAP in IOM Ethiopia,
    including a theory of change, and monitor the implementation of the
    AAP strategy.
2.  Review IOM Ethiopia’s practice of allocating a share of the budget
    to cross-cutting priorities, including AAP, in all projects, to
    ensure that the allocations are sufficient to implement core
    essential AAP activities.
3.  Formalize the AAP focal person role, by among other things including
    specific tasks and responsibilities in the terms of reference of the
    staff concerned and adding AAPrelated goals to the staff performance
    evaluation framework.
4.  Implement various compensation and recognition mechanisms, like
    certificates of recognition, to incentivize engagement as AAP focal
    person.
5.  Strengthen the integration of disability inclusion perspectives into
    AAP activities, addressing various types of disabilities - such as
    hearing impairment - within information sharing, community
    engagement and complaints mechanisms. Explore collaborative
    mechanisms with national and regional organizations for persons with
    impaired abilities.
6.  Strengthen a gender-responsive approach to AAP, notably with the
    recruitment and training of female hotline operators.
7.  Design and implement a comprehensive training course for hotline
    operators and CFM desk staff, inclusive of key principles of PSEAH,
    child protection, response to violence against marginalized and
    vulnerable individuals, and psychological first aid, as well as
    self-care and resources for staff well-being.
8.  Reinforce quality control of CFMs, through random verification of
    referral effectiveness, recording hotline calls for learning
    purposes and regular debriefings with CFM operators.
9.  Advocate for and contribute to stable and consistent funding for an
    AAP adviser position for the humanitarian response in Ethiopia
    through collaborative mechanisms with other key AAP actors in the
    country and in the IAAWG.
