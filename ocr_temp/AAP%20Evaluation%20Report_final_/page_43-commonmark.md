Community Voices, December 2023 The dashboard presents feedback gathered
from the community affected by the crisis across Ethiopia. It is
designed to help humanitarian responders make decisions and adapt
programming by providing insights into what communities are saying as
the response progresses. This dashboard is an interagency platform for
community engagement and accountability to affected populations in

Source: IOM, 2023f. IOM in Ethiopia promotes the participation of
affected people by integrating AAP-oriented approaches into regular data
collection exercises. It assesses the effectiveness of AAP mechanisms
systematically through tools such as post-distribution monitoring and
DTM site and village assessments. In 2023, with the support of the
Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, DTM integrated AAP indicators in its Site
Assessment Round 34 and Village Assessment Survey Round 17 tools, which
assess the mobility, needs and vulnerabilities of IDPs and returning
IDPs across Ethiopia. The analysis of these data led to the publication
of an AAP snapshot and a presentation to the IAAWG that informed its
2024 strategic plan. Enumerators working with IOM Ethiopia on DTM or
MEAL activities are trained on AAP and share the hotline number when
needed with affected people.

As the co-lead organization for the IAAWG, IOM Ethiopia facilitates
regular meetings and knowledge-sharing sessions, as well as maintaining
the Community Voices dashboard. In addition, in consultation with IAAWG
members, IOM conducted an AAP perception survey to reflect on AAP
practices and challenges among humanitarian actors in the country, and
to inform the production of information-sharing materials for the
working group. Capacitybuilding training on AAP and related topics was
provided by IOM MEAL staff to 121 working group partners in 2023.

Each of the 13 suboffices of IOM Ethiopia have two AAP focal persons who
received training (from the central MEAL unit) in AAP implementation and
mainstreaming. These focal persons are responsible for liaising with
various units in their respective suboffices to ensure that feedback
gathered from affected people is addressed. They also support AAP
assessments, trainings and community engagement activities such as
community committee trainings on AAP, and they document complaints and
feedback channels through face-to-face interactions. These AAP focal
personnel are initially hired using funding for a specific project to
fulfil various
