Data were also collected for post-assistance monitoring purposes in the
context of the refugee response programme. The team in charge of these
cross-border operations had set up a multilingual hotline and developed
a dedicated CFM application to track the calls and manage different

The two CFMs worked independently and were designed as different
solutions for different programmes, with no evident attempt to explore
synergies.
