sampling was selected for the case studies, to ensure comprehensive data
gathering. Additionally, during the data collection phase, further
relevant potential interviewees were identified through snowball
sampling, a method that locates additional key respondents during
interviews with initial informants. Table 1 represents the number of
respondents targeted by primary data collection methods.

### Limitations … page 14

Time constraints prevented all evaluation questions and perspectives
from being examined with the same level of detail. The evaluators had a
limited number of days to review the information, and the informants
faced time and workload challenges in providing comprehensive responses
and clarifications. As a result, not all of the evaluation questions
could be addressed fully.

Among the six OECD evaluation criteria, “impact” received less focus due
to the difficulty of measuring it across the various AAP policies,
guidelines and initiatives. Furthermore, the theory of change was a
challenging concept to elucidate because of insufficient input from
relevant internal respondents, and it was therefore recommended for
follow-up by the AAP Coordination Unit.

The evaluation team intended to interview key senior management members
at IOM Headquarters, but the designated officers were unavailable. This
limitation affected the inclusion of central-level senior officials’
perspectives in the findings and recommendations. Participation from
senior management members in IOM country offices was, however,
satisfactory.

Ultimately, another difficulty faced was the limited involvement of the
AAP Coordination Unit in the evaluation process. This issue might stem
from the fact that, at the time of this evaluation, an organizational
restructuring process was ongoing. Moreover, this evaluation was
commissioned by the CED, rather than the AAP Coordination Unit,
potentially making it seem to the AAP Coordination Unit an unforeseen
additional burden on already strained staff resources. Furthermore, some
key IOM officers, who had been directly involved with developing the AAP
Framework and coordinating related activities, had since moved to other
roles, rendering them either unavailable or less available to discuss
the findings and recommendations and to provide timely, detailed
thematic feedback. Given factors such as the time constraints, the
limited access to both senior management and AAP Coordination Unit
