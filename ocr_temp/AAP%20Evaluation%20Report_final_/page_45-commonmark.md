imbalances between humanitarian workers and affected communities. Noting
that the awareness of rights and the understanding of how to safeguard
against sexual exploitation and abuse is generally on the rise among
affected people, AAP mechanisms were perceived as essential to allow
instances of sexual abuse and exploitation, suspicious behaviours and
situations of feeling unsafe to be effectively reported.

Migrants and internally displaced individuals in Ethiopia may often
display heightened levels of vulnerability, with ample evidence being
available of abuses and human rights violations being perpetrated
against members of these groups, both within and outside of the country.
Informants perceived the implementation of AAP approaches as potentially
relevant also for preventing human rights violations. For example, the
hotline provides a channel for community members to raise concerns and
issues related to human rights violations.

Cross-Cutting Issues (Gender, Disability) Within the protection unit of
IOM Ethiopia, a dedicated team oversees PSEAH, gender and disability
concerns; AAP staff work very closely with this team. For example, all
AAP training courses are coordinated and organized jointly so as to
include AAP and PSEAH material together and have trainers from both
teams. The disability inclusion specialist is regularly invited to
provide inputs during AAP-related events. As the co-chair of the IAAWG,
IOM also closely engages with the Gender in Humanitarian Action Working
Group, the disability inclusion expert in the protection cluster and the
coordinator of the PSEAH network for contribution to strategic planning.

In CCCM settings, women undergo leadership training to enhance their
community engagement and decision-making roles. Reportedly, they have a
strong representation in community committees, with a growing community
acceptance of a 50 per cent women quota, actively facilitating
information dissemination, complaints submissions and beneficiary
targeting. Additionally, criteria like pregnancy, breastfeeding, and
disability are heavily considered in beneficiary selection, as women
representatives advocated for their rights, leading to increased female
involvement in previously male-dominated roles, such as shortterm jobs
and cleaning activities.

IOM staff and partners recognized the importance of conducting separate
consultations with women, to better understand their perspectives and
provide them with a safe space to share personal insights. Adjustments
to shelter designs and improvements in sanitation (soap and other
cleaning materials) have been made, based on such consultations. This is
especially important because in some cases women’s feedback has not been
taken seriously by organizations that operate in IDP sites. For
instance, women in an IDP camp in Tigray who participated in focus group
discussions highlighted issues with menstrual hygiene materials, stating
that they were provided with reusable sanitary pads instead of
disposable ones, creating challenges in camp settings due to the
scarcity of water and the discomfort of washing such personal items in
crowded shelters. Additionally, efforts were underway to raise resources
to hire female hotline operators to facilitate discussions on
gender-sensitive issues, such as GBV.
