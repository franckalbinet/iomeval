In Ethiopia, IOM implements operations of significant scale due to the
high incidence of migration and displacement in the country, often in
close collaboration with national and local authorities. This makes the
AAP approaches highly relevant to ensure that affected people contribute
to decision-making and are able to raise their concerns directly with
the Organization.

Informants consulted for this evaluation most often recognized AAP
approaches as highly relevant to the management and mitigation of
operational risks, especially when implemented systematically. AAP
systems were deemed effective when able to generate information useful
to anticipate, prevent, report and respond to various risk or threats.
The implementation of AAP approaches was generally seen as essential to
providing human-centred programming in the Ethiopian context, especially
in the context of multipurpose cash assistance and non-food item types
of interventions. Some informants noted how implementing AAP is “easier”
in the context of programmes targeting settled populations (that is,
populations residing in “fixed” locations for extended periods,
including IDP camps) compared to interventions targeting individuals in
transit, where additional challenges are faced (with AAP remaining
nonetheless relevant).

Application of AAP approaches was also seen as key for functions such as
displacement tracking, CCCM and PSEAH. AAP-related indicators were
integrated into data collection instruments administered by IOM
Ethiopia’s DTM unit. Information is being collected on affected people’s
knowledge of available CFMs, preferred CFM usage, preferred information
channels and perceived levels of participation in decision-making. As
the coordinator of 54 IDP sites in Ethiopia, IOM Ethiopia’s CCCM unit
was indicated as important in the implementation of AAP approaches due
to the daily interactions of CCCM staff with affected communities.

In 2023, IOM Ethiopia’s CCCM unit deployed an automated reporting system
for its CFM. This system, called Zite Manager, is used by CCCM help desk
officers to collect and register feedback and complaints, which are in
turn centrally analysed and shared with the responsible staff in
different units for follow-up. This system was perceived as offering
various advantages, including easier processing of feedback,
strengthened formal communication channels and greater adherence to data
protection principles.

Consulted IOM informants strongly believed that creating spaces and
mechanisms for affected community members to come forward and
communicate their complaints and challenges is important also for the
prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse. The absence or weakness of
AAP mechanisms was seen as highly detrimental to such prevention. At the
same time, the effectiveness of AAP mechanisms in the prevention of
sexual exploitation and abuse is conditional on the correct
understanding, robustness and systematic implementation of those
mechanisms, as well as on the extent to which these approaches can
address power
