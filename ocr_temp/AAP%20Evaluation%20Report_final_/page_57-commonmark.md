Examples of programme adaptation triggered by feedback received via the
CFMs were provided both in the context of refugee response and
cross-border operations. For instance, the schedule of vocational
training sessions was changed to allow easier participation by those
working regular hours; the expansion or introduction of cash-based
interventions in both contexts followed preferences shared by
beneficiaries; the introduction of Turkish language courses followed
requests from female beneficiaries; and school transportation services
were adapted to better serve needs.

Examples of insufficient or slow adaptation were also gathered.
According to some stakeholders consulted, the assistance received from
the cross-border programme was not always aligned with the needs of
people: for example, food kits were perceived as not relevant but
humanitarian programming took a long time to adjust to feedback. The
assistance was perceived as following a “pre-planned” model that could
not be changed easily (or at all), even if feedback was provided. Local
communities were known to complain that livelihood projects were
limited, demanding more structural interventions to promote economic
development (something not necessarily within the scope of the ongoing
interventions). Finally, the limited participation of local councils or
community leaders in needs assessments was mentioned, stressing how this
can affect the overall efficacy of AAP.

Data gathered for this case study suggest that there were limited
linkages between programme units and monitoring and evaluation
functions. Moreover, according to an informant, monitoring and
evaluation activities were sometimes left “out of the loop”. The same
informant perceived that many colleagues still viewed monitoring and
evaluation as an audit process rather than something that facilitates
learning and project adaptation. Processes for running AAP mechanisms
were generally not perceived as streamlined and a demand for more
in-depth and practical AAP training was voiced, as webinars and other
“virtual” forms of dissemination were not perceived as sufficient.

Several informants noted that acting on some of the complaints received
was more difficult than what it should have been. Answering such
complaints sometimes took longer than expected and doubts persisted on
what constitutes an efficient channel or solution to manage feedback
efficiently. Internal coordination between different teams within IOM
was seen as limited, and it was not always clear how to secure resources
for concrete follow-up actions, such as sharing vehicles for reaching
far away locations for beneficiary visits. Another set of difficulties
identified focused on how the ability of beneficiaries to express their
concerns and liaise with IOM in order to find solutions was constrained
by the beneficiaries’ lack of contextual information, lack of literacy
and vulnerability.

The limited collaboration between IOM and other United Nations partner
agencies mentioned above may have had repercussions on efficiency, as
well as on coherence. One informant stated that sometimes the issues
raised by beneficiaries went beyond the reach of IOM, and pointed to the
difficulty of coordinated responses. The same informant also explained
how the lack of coordination is fatiguing for affected people,
especially when similar questions are asked by different organizations,
and when responses do not follow the questions (“In some
