### A. 1 Accountability to Affected Populations in IOM Ethiopia … page 42

#### Background … page 42

The consultation in Ethiopia, conducted in February and March 2024,
involved KIIs with a total of 30 informants and five FGDs with a total
of 45 participants. Mehiret Habte led the consultations. This case study
is intended to provide valuable information and insight into the global
evaluation of AAP within IOM, by focusing on an IOM country office that
has built a significant AAP portfolio, encompassing both emergency and
non-emergency interventions. Acknowledgment is given to the engagement
and support of the MEAL team of IOM Ethiopia, as well as the AAP focal
points in the suboffices of the same IOM country office.

#### Ethiopia Context … page 42

In IOM Ethiopia, the overall coordination of AAP rests with the MEAL
unit. Three full-time personnel (one programme assistant and two hotline
operators), directly supported by one National MEAL officer and the MEAL
coordinator, dedicate about 25 per cent of their time to AAP. The other
two MEAL officers in the unit are also actively engaged in AAP. The
mission also established SOPs, AAP minimum requirements, and a
complaints and feedback referral workflow to standardize AAP activities.
These efforts aimed to enhance effective community participation and the
agency of affected people regarding whether and how IOM works with them.

Different feedback mechanisms are implemented in IOM Ethiopia. These
include a front-line help desk, a nationwide toll-free hotline service
in five languages (Amharic, English, Afan Oromo, Tigrigna and Somali),
exit interviews and community engagement initiatives, which are used to
allow communities to provide input on IOM and partners’ interventions.

Feedback gathered through IOM Ethiopia’s CFMs is consolidated into the
Community Voices initiative, a collective dashboard utilized by the
IAAWG to analyse trends in evolving community feedback, needs and
priorities. At the time of this evaluation, the latest publicly
available Community Voices report (December 2023: Figure 7) indicated
that there are 44,800 community feedback reports from 29 organizations
that have been analysed, highlighting food security as the most pressing
concern (IOM, 2023f). The integration of AAP data among the different
humanitarian agencies working in the area is a key achievement for the
international community in the country. Data gathered for this
evaluation suggest that Ethiopia is among the few countries with an
active community voice platform.
