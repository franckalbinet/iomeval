DTM teams have been informing communities of the hotline service, increasing the volume of calls. The fact that the service is toll free was also seen as important to facilitate access by affected people. The Community Voices dashboard is seen as an important achievement as it makes analysed CFM data available to a wide range of stakeholders, including civil society. This is done with the intent of informing decision-making.\nWhile a proper impact assessment is outside the scope of this evaluation and case study, examples were provided of how AAP implementation led to changes in assistance provision, including administrative measures such as staff dismissals or partnership discontinuations due to misconduct. In one case, community complaints regarding discrepancies in cash assistance due to currency exchange rate variations from United States dollars to Ethiopian birr led IOM to a change in the conversion method, to ensure that cash grant amounts are based on the latest exchange rate. In another, reports of food aid diversion made by affected people prompted the establishment of a dedicated task force to investigate the reports and take action. The integration and application of AAP within the food cluster was also perceived as impactful.\n\n\nSustainability … page 50\nThe systematic integration of AAP into projects (“mainstreaming”) requires that AAP components are included from the design stage and that budgets allocate resources specifically to AAP. As mentioned already, projects developed by IOM Ethiopia do often include a dedicated AAP budget allocation, and AAP is integrated into projects’ narratives. This is not formally required in IOM at large but only recommended. As a result, the mainstreaming of AAP in IOM Ethiopia’s programming remains subject to mission decisions and priorities, notwithstanding the fact that this country office made a significant effort and dedicated significant resources to AAP. Some informants pointed out how AAP is still not prioritized as it should be in project design and implementation. One informant stated that, in a situation where stringent budget constraints are faced, AAP is highly likely to be the first thing to be sacrificed. \\({ }^{29}\\)\nAAP implementation success also critically depends on understanding its concepts and technical aspects. Training was seen as necessary to this process, but not entirely sufficient, as\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{29}\\) As informed by discussants, having PSEAH officers is mandatory for every IOM mission; however, there is no similar requirement in the case of AAP. Thus, AAP application is mainly being implemented by focal persons."

    "text": "responsibilities and are chosen as AAP focal points based on their educational background, current roles and willingness to assume AAP duties on top of their regular ones.\n\nKey Findings … page 44\n\nRelevance … page 44\nIn Ethiopia, IOM implements operations of significant scale due to the high incidence of migration and displacement in the country, often in close collaboration with national and local authorities. This makes the AAP approaches highly relevant to ensure that affected people contribute to decision-making and are able to raise their concerns directly with the Organization.\nInformants consulted for this evaluation most often recognized AAP approaches as highly relevant to the management and mitigation of operational risks, especially when implemented systematically. AAP systems were deemed effective when able to generate information useful to anticipate, prevent, report and respond to various risk or threats. The implementation of AAP approaches was generally seen as essential to providing human-centred programming in the Ethiopian context, especially in the context of multipurpose cash assistance and non-food item types of interventions. Some informants noted how implementing AAP is “easier” in the context of programmes targeting settled populations (that is, populations residing in “fixed” locations for extended periods, including IDP camps) compared to interventions targeting individuals in transit, where additional challenges are faced (with AAP remaining nonetheless relevant).\nApplication of AAP approaches was also seen as key for functions such as displacement tracking, CCCM and PSEAH. AAP-related indicators were integrated into data collection instruments administered by IOM Ethiopia’s DTM unit. Information is being collected on affected people’s knowledge of available CFMs, preferred CFM usage, preferred information channels and perceived levels of participation in decision-making. As the coordinator of 54 IDP sites in Ethiopia, IOM Ethiopia’s CCCM unit was indicated as important in the implementation of AAP approaches due to the daily interactions of CCCM staff with affected communities.\nIn 2023, IOM Ethiopia’s CCCM unit deployed an automated reporting system for its CFM. This system, called Zite Manager, is used by CCCM help desk officers to collect and register feedback and complaints, which are in turn centrally analysed and shared with the responsible staff in different units for follow-up. This system was perceived as offering various advantages, including easier processing of feedback, strengthened formal communication channels and greater adherence to data protection principles.\nConsulted IOM informants strongly believed that creating spaces and mechanisms for affected community members to come forward and communicate their complaints and challenges is important also for the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse. The absence or weakness of AAP mechanisms was seen as highly detrimental to such prevention. At the same time, the effectiveness of AAP mechanisms in the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse is conditional on the correct understanding, robustness and systematic implementation of those mechanisms, as well as on the extent to which these approaches can address power"

    "text": "Informants highlighted some of the challenges pertaining to the coherence of AAP in IOM Ethiopia. These include inconsistent CFM mechanisms: the Zite Manager solution mentioned above is not used across all programmes and functions and plans to expand its usage have not been implemented due to a lack of resources. Some alternative programme- or project-specific CFMs are in place, and their operation is not necessarily coordinated with the work of the AAP focal persons. A second challenge is that some complaints remain unanswered, either by IOM or by implementing partners, sometimes because complaints may be challenging to address, and other times because addressing them is beyond the capacity or scope of IOM or its partners. An example of the latter is the suspension of food aid by donors in 2023, which was beyond the direct control or influence of IOM Ethiopia. A third challenge noted by informants, this one with respect to the AAP focal persons, is that sometimes AAP activities became secondary to other responsibilities due to workload, directions received from supervisors, or the lack of specific incentives to undertake AAP duties on top of “normal” responsibilities. A fourth challenge observed by informants was the way that some colleagues essentially intend AAP as mere CFM management, without recognizing or engaging with the broader scope and depth of AAP principles and approaches.\n\nInter-Agency Coherence and Coordination … page 47\nThe IAAWG was launched in 2009 by organizations seeking to improve accountability processes. This initiative facilitates inter-agency cooperation and coordination in Ethiopia. The terms of reference were developed in 2013, followed by a memorandum of understanding in 2019. The group operates with rotational leadership and is currently chaired by IOM and cochaired by Plan International.\nThe primary objective of the working group was to achieve horizontal and vertical harmonization among member agencies by standardizing AAP frameworks, indicators and measurement methods. Over time, the working group came to acknowledge that the diversity in AAP frameworks and approaches among member organizations was a value rather than a limitation, shifting its focus to sharing best practices through a community of practice.\nStandardized reporting tools for CFM data have been developed, albeit in manual Microsoft Excel-based formats, with ongoing discussions on how to automate the template for greater efficiency. The consolidated data are analysed using Microsoft’s Power BI to produce the Community Voices report, which is meant to inform planning and decision-making at cluster and humanitarian country team levels. However, less than half of working group members are actively engaging with this initiative.\nCoordination with regard to AAP between IOM and other agencies in the IDP camps settings, where IOM is responsible for CCCM, was also observed to be in place. However, according to informants, only 60 to 70 per cent of all complaints are answered: in some instances, complaints and requests for services are be shared with CCCM staff by community members, but either there is no service provider in the area able to provide the requested service, or service providers present are unable to respond to the complaints."

    "text": "direct experience and the availability of dedicated support were also seen as key to real internalization. At the time of the consultations, AAP training courses targeting staff in suboffices were ongoing.\nThe toll-free hotline service - a “milestone” achievement according to some informants - was generally perceived as fundamental to IOM Ethiopia’s core programming and as being effectively maintained. However, some informants pointed to the risk of reducing AAP to mere CFM management, remarking how relying solely on the hotline is insufficient to follow AAP principles in a broader sense.\nAAP indicators have been integrated into monitoring and evaluation tools and activities, and the DTM surveys, to facilitate regular monitoring and assessment processes. However, there is no dedicated theory of change for AAP, nor a consolidated and comprehensive monitoring framework. Additionally, as mentioned already, some informants lamented the absence of “deeper” assessments into the quality and effectiveness of AAP-related activities.\nMost of the mainstreaming efforts are managed by focal persons at different levels. Responsibilities associated with AAP in most cases are not considered as part of the main role and responsibilities of such focal persons. No evidence was found regarding whether assuming AAP-related responsibilities is recorded in formal documents such as the terms of reference of the staff member’s position.\n\nLessons learned … page 51\nThe integration of AAP indicators in data collection processes, particularly regarding community preferences with regard to information channels, participation modalities and CFMs, has proven to be very effective in advocating for resource allocation to AAP and demonstrating the need to fine-tune AAP activities based on the context. Indeed, these data in Ethiopia have shown that preferences and practices vary widely from region to region, with significant differences in terms of preferred language, medium, community structures for accountability, trust in international organizations, government officials or other stakeholders, and so on. This integration has informed IOM approaches but has also contributed to ensuring that the IAAWG strategic plan for 2024 was informed by this evidence.\nWhile AAP capacity was initially centralized in the Ethiopia Country Office in Addis Ababa, efforts to train frontline and suboffice staff since 2023 have contributed to creating a common understanding of AAP across the different operations of IOM. These efforts have also led to increases in the perceived value of AAP activities performed by programme staff, as well as to more frequent solicitation for AAP-related support (for example, to conduct assessments, facilitate stakeholder or community trainings, or set up CFM desks during distributions). AAP focal persons in IOM Ethiopia suboffices play a key role in meeting the growing demand for AAP-related support.\nAAP assessments show that beneficiaries often seek information or raise complaints to security or cleaning staff in offices or migrant centres, as they are often easier to approach. The AAP-oriented trainings targeting these staff categories specifically were greatly appreciated."

The IOM country offices selected for these case studies were Ethiopia and Türkiye, based on specific criteria. The IOM presence in Ethiopia is one of its largest, including a country office in Addis Ababa, 14 field offices, as well as Migration Response Centres, migration health assessment clinics and transit centres. It has a highly articulated operational and political setup, encompassing both crisis and non-crisis situations. Within IOM, IOM Ethiopia is considered as having a significant or even comprehensive AAP portfolio. IOM Türkiye was selected because Türkiye was one of the “pilot countries” in which the AAP Framework was initially tested. Additionally, IOM Türkiye makes an interesting case because it applied AAP approaches to cross-border operations with Syria in ways that were seen as innovative.\nThe analysis of the case studies followed the same evaluation criteria as the overall exercise. Interview guides for the case studies were adapted from those used in interviews with IOM staff in other regions, to maintain consistency in the investigation of the primary themes. Data collected regarding the case studies were qualitative, obtained through observations, interviews and focus group discussions. These case studies aimed not to generalize experiences but to identify effective and ineffective practices, understand how information was being communicated from IOM Headquarters, and map out lessons learned. The two case studies were valuable because the experiences of those involved in them were in some ways different and in others similar, adding depth and specificity to the global findings. They effectively illustrated the results gathered from global surveys and interviews with IOM staff at various levels (national, regional and global).\n\n\nSampling … page 13\nIn the inception phase, the evaluation examined the views of IOM staff with a key role or a vested interest in AAP to identify crucial informants for primary data collection.

    "text": "framework. There is clear progress in the implementation of AAP within IOM, but any claim of “AAP mainstreaming” within the Organization cannot be reasonably demonstrated.\n\nAt a decentralized level, there are examples of IOM being able to set up articulated systems and initiatives that promote AAP, with tangible effects on operations. However, sustaining and scaling up these initiatives is challenging. AAP implementation at the level of IOM country offices is predominantly undertaken in the context of specific projects or thematic areas. This may often lead to a “fragmented approach” where solutions and activities implemented in one area are not necessarily replicated or extended to other relevant ones. The case of IOM Ethiopia stood out as an important attempt at “institutionalising” AAP in the country office structure, as well as devising a mechanism to fund AAP activities from all ongoing projects in the mission.\nThere are known gaps that reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of activities promoting AAP at a decentralized level. These include a lack of full integration of AAP into the IOM project cycle; a lack of standard solutions and technical resources for the development and management of complaint and feedback mechanism (CFM) systems; a lack of technical resources and support to make full use of data gathered from affected people; and, finally, a lack of capacity to engage with other actors to promote “collective accountability”.\n\nIn conclusion, the evaluation largely confirms the findings from the 2023 MOPAN assessment, while also drawing a more nuanced and detailed picture of how IOM is pursuing its institutional commitments regarding AAP. Nine recommendations are put forward for IOM senior management and for the AAP team, to address the gaps identified:\n\nClarify that the scope and applicability of AAP extends beyond emergency response operations, reinforcing also the message on the mandatory nature of \\(\\mathrm{IN} / 285\\).\nDevelop an operational medium- to longer-term strategy for AAP, to be negotiated at the highest leadership level, with a three-year plan connected to a funding strategy.\nIn conjunction with Recommendation 2 (develop an AAP strategy), develop a theory of change and a dedicated monitoring and evaluation framework for AAP.\nStrengthen central AAP functions, ensuring that the size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters becomes adequate to meet AAP strategic objectives and that there is capacity to proactively support country offices to structure their approach to AAP implementation.\nSupport country offices in developing office-wide approaches to AAP implementation and funding, reducing fragmentation.\nIncrease the visibility of AAP activities, both internally and externally, on the basis of a clear visibility and knowledge management plan."

    "text": "relative isolation, most often at the level of single projects, with rare instances where efforts were coordinated to devise solutions applicable to entire country offices. \\({ }^{17}\\)\nThe predominant perception is that CFM development and management is an area of AAP that is particularly unstructured and lacking guidance, and one where significant duplication of effort may be taking place. Different examples of CFM systems of varying complexity and functions were gathered, always in the context of autonomous development. These narrations sometimes pointed at the significant upfront costs of setting up these systems, at how IOM may be incurring these costs multiple times across the different autonomous initiatives, and how these costs remain to date an insurmountable barrier for some smaller projects or country offices to set up “modern” solutions. “IOM needs a systematic approach and structure for CFMs at field offices. Now there are separate, messy systems different across every [country office] and confusion on whether MEAL, Communications, or other function should manage them; confusion on how to use the feedback into and out of the country office and no systematic system to track followups.”\nIOM staff.\nWhile flexibility and autonomy may promote innovation and better adaptation to different contexts, no informant elaborated on or suggested that a structured initiative is in place to map CFM solutions in the Organization, to identify scalable ones, or to identify and disseminate good practice in general. The development of a “standard CFM system” was sometimes mentioned as needed, although with some caveats and scepticism on the possibility of this solution being available in the short or medium term, with the suggestion that the Organization could look also at what other organizations have developed.\nAnother common theme in the responses concerning CFMs was the limited capacity to consolidate CFM data and produce analyses with uses that go beyond the reporting requirements of the specific project that funded the CFM. Most informants felt that data gathered through CFMs were not being fully utilized due to limited incentives or resources to go beyond the reporting requirements, which are very often based on simplistic indicators that merely count the number of complaints received and responded to, without looking at how those complaints are addressed. \\({ }^{18}\\)\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{17}\\) Case studies 1 and 2 provide some details on the CFM systems in use in IOM Türkiye and IOM Ethiopia, and how their use may be limited to specific units or projects within the respective country offices. IOM Sudan was indicated by one informant as having developed a comprehensive CFM system, inclusive also of follow-up monitoring functionalities, although this solution could not be reviewed as part of this evaluation. \\({ }^{18}\\) The points raised in this paragraph should be read in conjunction with Finding 2.2 on collective accountability."

    "text": "imbalances between humanitarian workers and affected communities. Noting that the awareness of rights and the understanding of how to safeguard against sexual exploitation and abuse is generally on the rise among affected people, AAP mechanisms were perceived as essential to allow instances of sexual abuse and exploitation, suspicious behaviours and situations of feeling unsafe to be effectively reported.\nMigrants and internally displaced individuals in Ethiopia may often display heightened levels of vulnerability, with ample evidence being available of abuses and human rights violations being perpetrated against members of these groups, both within and outside of the country. Informants perceived the implementation of AAP approaches as potentially relevant also for preventing human rights violations. For example, the hotline provides a channel for community members to raise concerns and issues related to human rights violations.\nCross-Cutting Issues (Gender, Disability) Within the protection unit of IOM Ethiopia, a dedicated team oversees PSEAH, gender and disability concerns; AAP staff work very closely with this team. For example, all AAP training courses are coordinated and organized jointly so as to include AAP and PSEAH material together and have trainers from both teams. The disability inclusion specialist is regularly invited to provide inputs during AAP-related events. As the co-chair of the IAAWG, IOM also closely engages with the Gender in Humanitarian Action Working Group, the disability inclusion expert in the protection cluster and the coordinator of the PSEAH network for contribution to strategic planning.\nIn CCCM settings, women undergo leadership training to enhance their community engagement and decision-making roles. Reportedly, they have a strong representation in community committees, with a growing community acceptance of a 50 per cent women quota, actively facilitating information dissemination, complaints submissions and beneficiary targeting. Additionally, criteria like pregnancy, breastfeeding, and disability are heavily considered in beneficiary selection, as women representatives advocated for their rights, leading to increased female involvement in previously male-dominated roles, such as shortterm jobs and cleaning activities.\nIOM staff and partners recognized the importance of conducting separate consultations with women, to better understand their perspectives and provide them with a safe space to share personal insights. Adjustments to shelter designs and improvements in sanitation (soap and other cleaning materials) have been made, based on such consultations. This is especially important because in some cases women’s feedback has not been taken seriously by organizations that operate in IDP sites. For instance, women in an IDP camp in Tigray who participated in focus group discussions highlighted issues with menstrual hygiene materials, stating that they were provided with reusable sanitary pads instead of disposable ones, creating challenges in camp settings due to the scarcity of water and the discomfort of washing such personal items in crowded shelters. Additionally, efforts were underway to raise resources to hire female hotline operators to facilitate discussions on gender-sensitive issues, such as GBV."

    "text": "Protection, PSEAH, and AAP when interacting with vulnerable groups.” Ultimately, many informants attributed these challenges to the “projectized” nature of IOM, where individual initiatives proceed in a more or less autonomous manner.\nInformants located in field offices also noted that different policies and thematic initiatives in IOM are, de facto, in competition with each other, as the resources and staff time available for their implementation may often be severely constrained. More or less deliberate trade-offs have to be made concerning different policies, noting also how support coming from IOM Headquarters is generally specific to a single initiative or theme, ignoring the interrelationships with other frameworks.\nA lack of coherence between AAP and the Data Protection Policy was mentioned by informants: obstacles to sharing AAP data (because such data include personal information) were noted in some cases, and a lack of support for the definition of data sharing agreements was noted in others. While the merit of these perceptions could not be verified as a technical analysis of the coherence between the AAP Framework and the Data Protection Policy goes beyond the scope of this evaluation, this instance is presented as an example of frameworks that may not have been fully coordinated in their development and in their implementation, for the further consideration of technical experts in IOM.\nFinding 2.2. There are instances where IOM promoted or supported collective accountability through its AAP initiatives, but there are also instances where coordination or collaboration with other actors was lacking. “Collective accountability” emerged as a central theme in the narrations of the informants and is an area where there may be an unmet demand for additional guidance, support and monitoring.\nIn Ethiopia, a joint platform exists where United Nations agencies and various organizations involved in the AAP working group can input data for shared use amidst the ongoing crisis. In this context, the IOM Ethiopia Chief of Mission provided direct reports to the United Nations Country Team on the feedback from affected people (see Case study 1). An additional significant case shared was the Response for Venezuela coordination platform, created by the Office of the Special Envoy for the Venezuela Response, with IOM acting as inter-agency AAP coordinator since 2021. According to IOM informants, the platform was crucial in orchestrating efforts across South America to assist Venezuelan migrants. In both examples, unified platforms were created for agencies to use AAP data collectively and conduct shared initiatives (such as AAP-related training courses), with perceived benefits to coherence and efficiency.\nAt the same time, informants also indicated the presence of significant obstacles and missed opportunities related to collaboration with other United Nations agencies and other organizations in terms of AAP. Almost all informants based in field locations that were consulted for this evaluation mentioned how, very often, feedback collected through CFMs cannot be fully acted upon by IOM alone, lamenting also the lack of a collective accountability approach by which different humanitarian and development actors could provide a coordinated and consolidated response to the issues raised. Informants noted that the fragmentation of AAP systems (across separate organizations) sometimes means that multiple"

What systems are in place to collect and integrate the views of affected populations in IOM’s work?\nEQ17.

Are the specific resources allocated to AAP managed efficiently?\nEQ18. Are the systems in place to support IOM offices in fundraising for AAP interventions efficient, adaptive, and cost-effective?\nEQ20. Is IOM efficient in supporting and enhancing staff expertise and development in the field of AAP?\n\nFinding 4.1 The amount of resourcing allocated to AAP is inadequate to pursue institutional objectives, and the funding of AAP is not approached in strategic terms. The size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters increased but remained modest for the workload. \\({ }^{10}\\)\nIOM was found to have implemented a large number of systems for collecting data from affected people. The decentralized structure of IOM was widely recognized by informants as conducive to tailoring AAP approaches to different operational and cultural contexts. Discussions of the diversity of tools used to engage affected people (including SMS, WhatsApp, social media, house visits, complaints boxes, hotlines, calls, surveys, focus group discussions and community engagement projects) emphasized the adaptability of IOM, particularly in challenging environments.\nAt the same time, informants interviewed for this evaluation overwhelmingly felt that the resources currently allocated to AAP in IOM Headquarters are insufficient to meet the demand for support and learning coming from country offices, as well as to drive the development or expansion of relevant guidance and resources. Some informants were frustrated by the absence of an overall funding strategy for AAP to support central AAP structures, noting how advancements often overly relied on the dedication of staffers instead of a structured and sustainable approach. At the country level, informants noted the way that funding for AAP functions often depends entirely on a single project-specific budget, with limited to no use of the (scarce) core resources available to country or regional offices, and rare cases of pooling resources proportionally from different projects (see Case study IOM Ethiopia for an example).\nThe size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters has expanded over time, though it clearly remains disproportionately small when considering the size of the Organization, as well as the fact that AAP is a mandatory aspect of the work of IOM since the formalization of the AAP Framework into IN/285.

However, this evaluation found that good practices in the field of AAP were not being identified and disseminated systematically. AAP activities and solutions remain, to a large extent, implemented in isolation, leading to missed opportunities to upscale or synergize with the initiatives of other projects, units or offices.\nFinding 1.3 The role of AAP in promoting cross-cutting themes is considered in the AAP Framework, with practical applications on the ground. The relevance of AAP for environmental sustainability is, however, not considered.\nThe IOM AAP Framework integrates diversity inclusion principles, focusing on vulnerable and marginalized groups, encompassing human rights, gender equality, and disability. IOM staff informants understood and highlighted the importance of AAP for promoting diversity inclusion. The framework specifies groups such as women, children, LGBTQIA+ individuals, the elderly, people with disabilities and ethnic and religious minorities, among others. During field visits in Türkiye and Ethiopia, particular attention was found to be given to women and individuals with disabilities in different AAP initiatives. More generally, the data gathered suggest that IOM employs multiple mechanisms to engage vulnerable populations, offering guidance on reaching out to the most excluded and amplifying the voices of women, youth and other traditionally marginalized groups.\nNumerous instances were identified where women’s specific needs were addressed and individuals with disabilities were included in focus group discussions and other consultation methods. However, environment-related inputs are not included in IN/285; further, AAP activities carried out in country offices that were observed or reviewed did not seem to consider the role of AAP in promoting environmental sustainability.\nFinding 1.4 The “operational” nature of IOM, and its direct interaction with affected people, give it a comparative advantage in the implementation of AAP initiatives. However, the contribution of IOM to AAP has limited visibility.\nConsidering that AAP is a responsibility of the humanitarian and development sector as a whole rather than of single or specific organizations, some evaluation questions asked respondents to explore how IOM contributes to the advancement of AAP from a sectorial and collective perspective. Having a “local focus” and being a “frontline” actor were the most frequently indicated comparative advantages of IOM.\nSeveral informants highlighted the potential of IOM to drive significant advancements in the AAP collective space and to foster “collective accountability”. \\({ }^{11}\\) The Ethiopia case study (Case study 1) illustrates the work done by IOM in this country to provide a platform for the analysis and dissemination of AAP data shared by different actors. However, some informants\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{11}\\) As noted in the IOM APP Framework (IOM, 2020c2), “There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of collective accountability.” However, as that document explains, the term is often used in the context of AAP discussions to indicate that “multiple humanitarian actors are engaged in joint programming, provide common services and pursue collective outcomes”, and that therefore “[a]ll actors involved in such joint efforts are required to ensure AAP obligations and commitments are upheld”. For more, see Finding 2.2 below. In the context of this evaluation, “collective accountability” broadly refers to how AAP should be undertaken jointly by different organizations present in a given operational context, to the extent they are all collectively accountable for their interventions (and the coordination between those interventions) among affected people."

Additionally, developing standard indicators to monitor progress at both project and institutional level is essential.”\nIOM staff.\nTraining provided by IOM Headquarters on IN/285 was appreciated, but there were also frequent calls for more detailed and technical follow-ups on the practical (“how to”) aspects of AAP. As stated by one survey respondent, “Guidance and tools should be much shorter and accessible to facilitate use for people who work extended hours and live under difficult conditions.” Several informants stressed the importance of including concrete examples to illustrate practical AAP applications and benefits. These needs were already known by members of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters, and the creation of a more practical toolkit to fill some of the gaps was underway.\nThe AAP unit in IOM Headquarters effectively disseminated the AAP Framework and established a point of reference within the Organization, despite its relatively small size.

The lack of a comprehensive response to AAP was felt against the backdrop of a growing awareness of this framework and its relevance, although some informants doubted whether the level of awareness of the senior management of IOM Türkiye on global AAP policy was adequate.\nCollaboration on AAP between IOM and other organizations was observed to be limited, as IOM was perceived as working more autonomously than other United Nations agencies. The awareness of governmental partners of AAP was not assessed specifically, but it was observed that CFMs and community engagement initiatives led by local government agencies were in place; there was, however, no clear connection between these initiatives and the IOM ones. Some informants noted that, initially, government agencies did not seem to understand the value of engaging with communities, but that their attitude changed after activities in community spaces were completed and started bearing fruits.\n\nEffectiveness … page 56\nAs already described, at the time of this evaluation, there was a monitoring and evaluation system in place for cross-border operations in IOM Türkiye, as many activities were carried out by implementing partners and not directly by IOM. Some informants perceived this system as costly and of uncommon scale for IOM standards. Monitoring and evaluation data and findings, including from the CFM, were recognized as useful to inform adjustments to programming, but not necessarily sufficient to inform strategic decisions or organizational change in a broader sense. Some informants also perceived that the data gathered were not being fully utilized.\nThe multilingual hotline deployed for the refugee response programme was relatively new, and potential users were being targeted by communications to inform them of this service. Some informants mentioned that complaints and concerns were often received by field staff directly rather than through dedicated communication channels, explaining that this was happening because IOM staff were generally perceived by beneficiaries as open and supportive. Some challenges with the management of the CFM were mentioned, often in relation to translating feedback into concrete adjustments or learning. In the words of one survey respondent from Türkiye, “Complaint and feedback mechanism remain a challenge on how to use these successfully.”"

However, some findings point at how the “fragmented” funding approach based on individual projects (and the uncertainties that come with that) may be creating inefficiencies, especially in terms of duplication when developing and managing CFMs (a domain of AAP on which an urgent need for institutional guidance and resources was often voiced). These narratives stress the importance of greater communication and collaboration on AAP between different projects, technical areas and implementing units, establishing wherever there are possible office-wide approaches to AAP.\nAssessing the impact of AAP initiatives goes beyond the scope of this evaluation and its methodological design. It is, however, hoped that these findings might help identify cases that can be the subject of robust impact assessments in the future.\nThe release of IN/285 was a milestone achievement for IOM engagement with AAP. By providing a legal foundation for the IOM commitment to AAP, this document is one of the pillars for the sustainability of IOM AAP engagement. Active participation in the IASC on AAP was largely perceived to have brought benefits in terms of resource mobilization and awareness, leading to the conclusion that this engagement should not dwindle. Moreover, there are clear signs that AAP principles and values are penetrating IOM “corporate culture”, with more and more staff understanding the need for and advantages of accountability, including important aspects of it such as meaningful community engagement and robust CFMs. Conversely, uneven support for AAP among the senior management of the Organization (with a gap noted in IOM Headquarters leadership), the inadequate resources allocated to AAP, as well as the absence of a clear strategic approach to AAP funding and implementation (at both central and country office levels), all cast a shadow over the sustainability of AAP, with the risk of increasing perceptions that IOM commitments on this matter remain more aspirational than real."

This was perceived as a positive development, with consequences such as more effective service provision and more accessible camp infrastructure. Additionally, the integration of disability-related considerations into monitoring tools was ongoing, reflecting a commitment to strengthening inclusiveness and responsiveness. However, as visible disabilities were perceived as receiving relatively more attention, challenges were acknowledged in addressing less visible forms of disability. For instance, at the time of data collection, there were no operational mechanisms for information sharing for people with a hearing impairment, including no CFM adapted for the hearing impaired. Hotline services, in particular, may be impractical for individuals with such disabilities. Intellectual disabilities were also mentioned as something to be considered in relation to increasing the accessibility of communication material and CFMs.\n\nCoherence and Integration … page 46\n\nCoherence and coordination within IOM … page 46\nConsultations held as part of this case study suggest that IOM Ethiopia has been implementing AAP approaches for some time, although not always labelling these initiatives as AAP. For example, engaging members of affected communities through the establishment of camp committees or through information sharing was a common feature in different interventions even before the formalization of AAP approaches within the country office.\nThe adoption of the comprehensive AAP Framework in IOM Ethiopia sought to formalize and systematize the various ongoing AAP-related initiatives, and also to increase their effectiveness. An example is the collection and processing of complaints and feedback, which was initially conducted with different solutions and approaches by different units or projects. The Zite Manager application was developed specifically for harmonizing complaints and feedback collection practices within CCCM functions, by providing a single solution. This application was perceived as having significantly enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of these processes.\nTo ensure coherence across programmes, IOM Ethiopia mandated training on AAP and PSEAH for all staff. \\({ }^{27}\\) Collaborative training by PSEAH officers and the AAP teams avoids misconceptions about separate CFM systems. The handling of PSEAH-related reports follows specific procedures, and all IOM staff with whom a PSEAH-related allegation is shared, including hotline operators, are expected to report these directly on the institutional We Are All In reporting platform, regardless of how the report was made in the first place (whether directly to the staff member or through an available CFM). In the context of IOM Ethiopia, AAP focal persons follow-up on non-sensitive complaints and focus on the formulation of feedback related to programmes for IOM and partners. In IOM Ethiopia suboffices, AAP focal persons often also serve as PSEAH focal persons, potentially strengthening linkages between the two domains.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{27}\\) This differs from global institutional practice, where AAP training is not mandatory."

In addition, 97 per cent thought that they could channel their suggestion or lodge a complaint if they had one, and 87 per cent of respondents reported that, to their knowledge, suggestions and complaints raised were responded to.\n\nEfficiency … page 49\nMainstreaming AAP into existing programmes is currently achieved through ensuring that each project contributes a certain percentage of the costs of a dedicated staff member and by allocating a specific percentage of the budget from each project to cross-cutting issues, including AAP. This strategy is a good practice that allows the MEAL team to continuously conduct AAP activities. This approach ensures the sustainability of key elements of IOM Ethiopia’s AAP approach, such as the hotline and field staff capacity-building, as well as the ability to respond to programmatic needs and requests. It is to be noted, however, that hotline operators are not on staff contracts, which may jeopardize their willingness to remain with the Organization.\nAAP focal points in suboffices (existing staff members include roles such as the WASH coordinator, the sexual and reproductive health officer, and the protection associate, who are designated as focal persons to oversee AAP initiatives on top of their “regular” responsibilities) are also a key feature of IOM Ethiopia’s AAP approach. These focal persons are chosen in consultation with the heads of suboffices. This arrangement is deemed to be cost effective, as it does not entail additional staff costs, while also yielding significant benefits. The focal persons are able to conduct community, staff and stakeholder training courses, contribute to AAP assessments, and channel, refer and respond to complaints and feedback in line with the expected standards. However, as the AAP-related tasks are added to the focal points’ primary duties, their timely completion relies heavily on available time and the readiness of staff themselves and their direct management to dedicate time for AAP. No system is in place to formally acknowledge achievements or address underperformance concerning AAP-related tasks and responsibilities specifically.\nIn general, the mechanisms available for quality control of AAP activities are insufficient. While the satisfaction of beneficiaries with AAP mechanisms are verified in monitoring and evaluation surveys, there are no “deeper” methods to verify the quality of the response in place, such as recording of calls, or ad hoc verification of referral effectiveness. AAP and CFM operators are not systematically trained in all areas in which they may be required to respond, in order to be able to respond appropriately to diverse beneficiaries and causes for complaint; such areas can include PSEAH, child protection, response to violence towards marginalized or vulnerable groups or psychological first aid. The wellbeing of AAP and frontline staff who are responsible for receiving feedback and complaints is also not systematically monitored.\nThe strategy of assigning AAP responsibilities to staff in different roles is also observed in interagency cooperation. MEAL and information management officers from organizations like IOM, Plan International, and OCHA are often responsible for CFM data management. This is deemed to be efficient in terms of leveraging existing expertise and mainstreaming AAP principles."

In 2023, with the support of the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, DTM integrated AAP indicators in its Site Assessment Round 34 and Village Assessment Survey Round 17 tools, which assess the mobility, needs and vulnerabilities of IDPs and returning IDPs across Ethiopia. The analysis of these data led to the publication of an AAP snapshot and a presentation to the IAAWG that informed its 2024 strategic plan.

    "text": "The complexity of the JI-HoA and the integrated approach, and the fragility of existing systems in the Horn of Africa countries, leads to the conclusion that ownership and sustainability of the programme cannot be expected after five years of implementation. Important progress has been made, but continued support is needed in terms of capacity-building, but also for wider socio-economic development and security in the four countries in general.\nNamely, the vast majority of challenges and barriers to the achievements of the JI-HoA are linked to the context in which it takes place, and to external factors. Capacity-building efforts were undermined by political priorities and staff turnover; referral systems and service provision for migrants and returnees were hindered by a lack of a structure national referral mechanism, well-functioning health and social security systems, and economic support lost value in the face of a deteriorating economic situation and inflation. Activities of the JI were furthermore hindered by civil conflict and security issues. Therefore, the situation of returnees cannot be addressed without simultaneously addressing the wider socio-economic context.\n\n5.2. Recommendations … page 28\nBased on the conclusions of the evaluation, the evaluation team has designed the following recommendations towards migrant protection, return and reintegration programming.\n\nEnhance efforts with national, regional, and local stakeholders to build capacity and ownership (while continuing provision of funding).\n\nThe EU-IOM Joint Initiative has put visible effort in building the capacity of national actors to support return and reintegration. However, political priorities did not always ensure ownership and commitment of governments to take the JI results forward. Additionally, turnover of staff has removed trained staff and therefore undone some of the work of the JI in this regard.\nTwo important steps need to be taken to enhance the capacity and ownership of key stakeholders, which would set the scene for sustainability and impact. Firstly, capacity building should be expanded to a wider scope of persons. This should include the entire relevant organisational departments, ensuring the participation of top and middle management as well as their staff.\nSecondly, capacity alone is not sufficient to ensure impact and sustainability of the work on return and reintegration. Therefore, migrant protection, return and reintegration programming should focus also on enhancing ownership and commitment of stakeholders towards these topics. Possible steps include the gradual integration of MRCs with the relevant public sector organizations, or coownership/management of the MRCs by local governments (along with IOM) where some of the employees are funded by the local government. In addition, the migrant protection, return and reintegration programming should continue to support the integration of return and reintegration into policy documents and development plans\nHowever, sustainability and independent work by governments and stakeholders is not something that should be expected in the near future. Therefore, financial resources from donors will still need to be allocated to governments and stakeholders to implement their policies and services for returnees."

Four FGDs were held in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Somalia, and one FGD in Djibouti.\nThe final debriefing workshop, focused on dissemination of the findings and conclusions of the evaluation, helped the evaluation team to validate the findings of the evaluation and collect valuable reflections from IOM staff. The findings from the debriefing were integrated to the final evaluation report.\nThe evaluation was based on numerous consultations with stakeholders and IOM staff, and extensive review of documentation. However, certain external and internal factors influenced the implementation of the evaluation:\n\nThe political and security situation in the programme countries prevented the team from exploring some of the programme implementation localities. In Ethiopia, the Tigray region and Amhara region were deemed not safe to visit, and in Somalia, the FGD in Burao was cancelled due to renewed security/political risks. Similarly, restrictions on travel in Sudan led the team to conduct one online FGD, one FGD where returnees were brought to Khartoum, and one region to be replaced with another FGD in Khartoum.\nNot all selected stakeholders were able or willing to make themselves available for an interview. Fortunately, these only comprised a few stakeholders across the region."

    "text": "According to the RA Monitoring and Satisfaction surveys, 56% of the surveyed returnees were satisfied or very satisfied with the reintegration assistance support provided by the JI-HoA \\({ }^{17}\\).\nFocus Group Discussions highlighted the importance of the economic assistance to enable returnees to develop sources of income (e.g. through start-up businesses or employment). Since returnees are coming back usually “empty-handed”, they are experiencing shame, guilt, and are stigmatised by their communities and relatives. The economic support offered by the JI-HoA not only provides them with resources to start their business but also restores their dignity and self-trust \\({ }^{18}\\).\nIn the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), some returnees pointed out that the overall value of the economic assistance was not enough. \\({ }^{19}\\) This was also confirmed by a stakeholder from Sudan, who suggested that returnees needed more money to satisfy their livelihood during the time of planting, growing and harvesting, since they put most of the microbusiness support into the producing and often have no other sources of income \\({ }^{20}\\). The microbusiness assistance did not always correspond to the knowledge of the recipient or the local context.

This indicates that irregular migrants are much more affected by the CMD compared to people who do not migrate.

The JI-HoA Programme’s Lessons Learned from the Psychosocial Support Component Report noted gaps in the post-return psychosocial support (e.g., lack of MHPSS service, unclear information about compensation of the treatment, high cost, stigma, and low awareness about MHPSS needs among communities) \\({ }^{24}\\).

The EU-IOM Joint Initiative in the Horn of Africa (JI-HOA) \\({ }^{1}\\) commenced in March 2017 in the Khartoum Process countries, with a focus on Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. \\({ }^{2}\\) The programme was coordinated by a Regional Coordination Unit (RCU) based in the IOM Regional Office for the East and Horn of Africa region (Nairobi, Kenya).\nIn accordance with the programme planning, the JI-HoA underwent a Mid-Term Evaluation in 2019 and a Final Independent Evaluation in 2022/2023, covering the 2017-2022 period, conducted by PPMI Group and commissioned by IOM. The evaluation covered the four JI core countries in the HoA, namely Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti, as well as the RCU based in Kenya given regionally implemented and coordinated activities, looking at all pillars of the Action (migration data; capacity building; awareness raising; protection and voluntary assisted return; and individual and communitybased reintegration).\nThe final evaluation assessed the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, and sustainability of the programme, with an eye on informing future programming. To this end, the evaluation assessed the achievements of the programme against its key objectives, including a re-examination of the relevance of the objectives and of the design. It also identified factors that have facilitated or impeded the achievement of the objectives.\nTo gather the necessary data, the evaluation relied on desk research, interviews with stakeholders, focus groups with beneficiaries, and a validation workshop. Furthermore, a range of monitoring and evaluation activities were already implemented under the JI-HoA. The results of these M&E activities formed an important data source for the current evaluation.\nThe current Report presents the findings of the evaluation against the evaluation criteria and provides holistic conclusions and recommendations to build on the achievements of the JI-HoA and improve future programming.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{1}\\) Formal title: Facility on Sustainable and Dignified Return and Reintegration in Support of the Khartoum Process \\({ }^{2}\\) As per the project’s Description of the Action, some limited activities mainly involving assisted voluntary return and reintegration (AVRR) were also carried out in other Khartoum Process countries (Eritrea as conditions allow, Kenya, South Sudan, and Uganda) and from countries along the Southern migration routes (notably Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Tanzania)"

    "text": "In 2016, the EU and IOM launched the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration, with as overall objective “To contribute to facilitating orderly, safe, regular and rights-based migration through the facilitation of dignified voluntary return and the implementation of development-focused and sustainable reintegration policies and processes”. The EU-IOM Joint Initiative in the Horn of Africa (JI-HOA) \\({ }^{1}\\) commenced in March 2017 in the Khartoum Process countries, with a focus on Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. \\({ }^{2}\\) The programme was coordinated by a Regional Coordination Unit (RCU) based in the IOM Regional Office for the East and Horn of Africa region (Nairobi, Kenya).\nIn accordance with the programme planning, the JI-HoA underwent a Mid-Term Evaluation in 2019 and a Final Independent Evaluation in 2022/2023, covering the 2017-2022 period, conducted by PPMI Group and commissioned by IOM. The evaluation covered the four JI core countries in the HoA, namely Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti, as well as the RCU based in Kenya given regionally implemented and coordinated activities, looking at all pillars of the Action (migration data; capacity building; awareness raising; protection and voluntary assisted return; and individual and communitybased reintegration).\nThe final evaluation assessed the relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, coherence, and sustainability of the programme, with an eye on informing future programming. To this end, the evaluation assessed the achievements of the programme against its key objectives, including a re-examination of the relevance of the objectives and of the design. It also identified factors that have facilitated or impeded the achievement of the objectives.\nTo gather the necessary data, the evaluation relied on desk research, interviews with stakeholders, focus groups with beneficiaries, and a validation workshop. Furthermore, a range of monitoring and evaluation activities were already implemented under the JI-HoA. The results of these M&E activities formed an important data source for the current evaluation.\nThe current Report presents the findings of the evaluation against the evaluation criteria and provides holistic conclusions and recommendations to build on the achievements of the JI-HoA and improve future programming.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{1}\\) Formal title: Facility on Sustainable and Dignified Return and Reintegration in Support of the Khartoum Process \\({ }^{2}\\) As per the project’s Description of the Action, some limited activities mainly involving assisted voluntary return and reintegration (AVRR) were also carried out in other Khartoum Process countries (Eritrea as conditions allow, Kenya, South Sudan, and Uganda) and from countries along the Southern migration routes (notably Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Tanzania)"

    "text": "4.2.1. The JI-HoA’s alignment with the objectives and standards of IOM, and objectives of the EU … page 14\nThe EU-IOM JI-HoA aligns with the purpose of IOM as described in its constitution. Providing assistance services for voluntary return migration is a core function of the organisation to ensure safe, orderly and dignified migration \\({ }^{36}\\). IOM’s international norms and standards regarding AVRR are centred around protecting migrants’ rights (to a safe and dignified return) and achieving sustainable reintegration. One of the main principles for IOM regarding AVRR, namely voluntariness, was followed by organizing information sessions of the AVRR programme. \\({ }^{37}\\).\nThe JI-HoA corresponds to the existing EU foreign policy documents and political trajectories. The EUIOM JI-HoA contributed to the objectives of the EU Trust Fund for Africa to emphasise greater economic and employment opportunities and improve migration management in countries of origin and transit. The JI-HoA is also aligned with the Valletta Action Plan, a framework for migration governance between Europe and Africa specifically addressing irregular migration in three regions, including the Horn of Africa, aimed at tackling migrant smugglers, fostering safe return and reintegration, migrant protection and effective governance of irregular migration \\({ }^{38}\\).\nSimilarly, the JI-HoA contributed to the European Agenda on Migration’s objectives, namely the focus on reducing incentives for irregular migration. The objective aims to track and eliminate the causes of irregular migration by developing regional cooperation frameworks, such as the Khartoum Process. A specific objective of the European Agenda, addressed by the JI-HoA, is the improvement of the EU’s return system through the sustainable approach to assisting return migration. \\({ }^{39}\\)\nLastly, while the project countries did not have comprehensive return and reintegration policies in place for the JI-HoA to strengthen/align with, national governments had developed broader strategies such as development plans, poverty reduction strategies and similar documents, to which objectives the JIHoA would also ultimately contribute.\n\n\n4.2.2. Alignment with other initiatives … page 14\nThe analysis of interviews with IOM staff, stakeholders and desk research revealed that IOM put sufficient efforts in mapping activities of different actors in each country to avoid duplication. Therefore, generally there were no duplication across different projects, rather examples of complementary support initiatives.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{36}\\) IOM. (2017). Constitution and Basic Texts.

    "text": "due to the urgency caused by the crisis in Libya, \\({ }^{85}\\) the top-up system was also necessary to widen the scope of the JI-HoA over time. On the other hand, the top-up budgeting system created uncertainties regarding the implementation budget, which hindered planning and budgeting.\nBased on the evaluated material, the human resources were mostly sufficient to meet the programme objectives. The Mid-term Review of the programme stated that there were staff shortages in the JI, and that staff among MRCs was not always distributed efficiently. \\({ }^{86}\\) However, the present evaluation found that improvements were made in the following years to ensure more available and more qualified staff to the programme. There were only a few limitations mentioned in interviews.\nAlthough there were delays in some activities, almost all final results were met by the end of the implementation period of the programme. Note that the initial timeline was amended several times in the course of budget expansion. Beyond financial problems, and the lack of the inception planning, security issues were the major - and most important - reason for delays in Horn of Africa. The security risks remained high for the whole region at the time of the JI-HoA programme and showed a deteriorating trend. \\({ }^{87}\\)\n\n4.4.2. Cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the programme … page 25\nBased on the evaluated materials and the self-assessment of JI-HoA employees, the programme was cost-effective overall, and it also increased the efficiency of some services despite challenges with resource management. As there were not enough resources provided to precisely estimate the distribution of the budget and staff, the following conclusions rest on estimations.\nSome assistance activities for beneficiaries became more efficient during the programme implementation. According to surveys, the return arrangements were better organized, and it became easier to get in touch with IOM for the application of return procedures. The time taken from return to receiving reintegration assistance also decreased, there were less people who had to wait seven or more months in later years. However, the waiting time for the response on return application fluctuated during the implementation. The delays in services could have been due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the instable security situation. The war in Tigray region in Northern Ethiopia broke out in 2020, which affected the capacity of the state of Ethiopia to support their citizens to return home.\nBased on the evaluated material it can be concluded that although the JI-HoA was effective in forming partnerships with service providers, additional measures are needed to ensure the stability and financial independence of these actors to increase the efficiency gains created. To decrease costs, partners were expected to complement JI-HoA services without any support or to take over activities and become self-sustaining. However, lack of resources, unstable states, government turnover and the lack of service providers in certain regions made the full reliance on partnerships impossible.\nNational referral systems were established in all countries, but they did not become fully effective and sustainable. This was mainly due to the lack of independent capacity in the region. The effective functioning of referral systems would have enabled IOM to hand over more services to state\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{85}\\) Mid-Term Review of EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration in the Horn of Africa \\({ }^{86}\\) Mid-Term Review of EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration in the Horn of Africa \\({ }^{87}\\) JI HoA Interim Narrative Report #1 and #4 to the European Union"

Additionally, no information was found in project documents and logframes on the exact objectives of awareness raising (i.e. this dimension did not have its own objectives, indicators and impact studies). It was not subject to specific evaluation under the JI-HoA.\nAssistance to stranded migrants … page 19\nThree indicators were designed to measure achievements regarding AVR. The JI supported 9025 migrants to return voluntarily to their countries of origin (against a target of 8450), and provided 8960 migrants in transit with protection and direct assistance (against a target of 8450 .\nAdditionally, between 2017-2022, the JI built, enhanced, rehabilitated or rented a total of 15 MRCs, thereby exceeding its target of 12 .

During the current evaluation, a Somalian stakeholder pointed out that voluntary return procedures still tend to take too long, creating difficulties for returnees. \\({ }^{62}\\) However, there are some factors (e.g. approval by the Ethiopian government, COVID-19 restrictions, conflicts) that can hinder the swift AVR of migrants beyond the control of IOM or the JI). \\({ }^{63}\\) In Djibouti stakeholders noted that return procedures have improved as voluntary return procedures and documentation of migrants was sped up allowing for quicker return processes. \\({ }^{64}\\)\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{59}\\) Interview with a stakeholder from Ethiopia \\({ }^{60}\\) JI HoA Interim Narrative Report #4 to the European Union \\({ }^{61}\\) JI HoA Interim Narrative Report #4 to the European Union \\({ }^{62}\\) Interview with a stakeholder from Somalia \\({ }^{63}\\) Interview with IOM staff \\({ }^{64}\\) Interviews with stakeholders from Djibouti"

As mentioned above, many returnees were glad to receive economic assistance, but deemed it too little to become economically reintegrated. \\({ }^{83}\\)\nAt the same time, community members who attended the FGDs noted that CBR projects contributed positively to economic and employment opportunities in the community. \\(92 \\%\\) of surveyed community members reported that they feel involved in the identification, design and/or implementation of community-based reintegration, exceeding the \\(70 \\%\\) target.\nSustainability of reintegration … page 23\nBesides the extent of economic, social, and psychosocial reintegration of returnees as a result of the JIHoA intervention, the IMPACT study also measured the sustainability of reintegration. The IMPACT study was the first impact evaluation to use IOM’s metric of sustainable reintegration, the Reintegration Sustainability Index (RSI). The RSI was further adjusted based on literature reviews, which resulted in an enhanced version of the institutional questionnaire, called RSS+. \\({ }^{84}\\)\nHowever, the methodology to assess the sustainability of reintegration is rather new and still subject to testing and improvement. Therefore, adjustments in measuring reintegration sustainability were made during the IMPACT study, considering the score threshold. The outcome of the RSS against the Reintegration Sustainability Score shows that a large difference exists between the use of the 0.5 and the 0.66 threshold. Using the former approach, \\(92 \\%\\) of the respondents recorded a score higher than the 0.5 threshold. Using the 0.66 threshold, only \\(53 \\%\\) of the respondents would be considered as having attained “sufficient levels of economic self-sufficiency, social stability and psychosocial wellbeing in their community of return”.\nTABLE 1.

However, factors external to the JI hindered the integrated approach from being effectively implemented at all levels.\nStakeholders noted, in particular, the combination of individual reintegration support and CBR projects, aimed to create better cohesion in communities and enable communities to support the reintegration process.

    "text": "However, the presence of a dedicated AAP adviser or coordinator supporting the IAAWG and its co-chairs is seen as essential to ensure coherence and maintain momentum in AAP implementation. The role requires significant technical expertise and coordination capacity. At the time of the evaluation, while an AAP adviser had been made available through stand-by partner agreements with IOM (in 2023) and OCHA (in 2024), no sustainable funding mechanism was in place to ensure the continuation of this role, putting in potential jeopardy the progress made in the previous years.\n\nImpact and Results … page 50\nThe toll-free hotline service established by IOM Ethiopia was perceived as a valuable resource. DTM teams have been informing communities of the hotline service, increasing the volume of calls. The fact that the service is toll free was also seen as important to facilitate access by affected people. The Community Voices dashboard is seen as an important achievement as it makes analysed CFM data available to a wide range of stakeholders, including civil society. This is done with the intent of informing decision-making.\nWhile a proper impact assessment is outside the scope of this evaluation and case study, examples were provided of how AAP implementation led to changes in assistance provision, including administrative measures such as staff dismissals or partnership discontinuations due to misconduct. In one case, community complaints regarding discrepancies in cash assistance due to currency exchange rate variations from United States dollars to Ethiopian birr led IOM to a change in the conversion method, to ensure that cash grant amounts are based on the latest exchange rate. In another, reports of food aid diversion made by affected people prompted the establishment of a dedicated task force to investigate the reports and take action. The integration and application of AAP within the food cluster was also perceived as impactful.\n\n\nSustainability … page 50\nThe systematic integration of AAP into projects (“mainstreaming”) requires that AAP components are included from the design stage and that budgets allocate resources specifically to AAP. As mentioned already, projects developed by IOM Ethiopia do often include a dedicated AAP budget allocation, and AAP is integrated into projects’ narratives. This is not formally required in IOM at large but only recommended. As a result, the mainstreaming of AAP in IOM Ethiopia’s programming remains subject to mission decisions and priorities, notwithstanding the fact that this country office made a significant effort and dedicated significant resources to AAP. Some informants pointed out how AAP is still not prioritized as it should be in project design and implementation. One informant stated that, in a situation where stringent budget constraints are faced, AAP is highly likely to be the first thing to be sacrificed. \\({ }^{29}\\)\nAAP implementation success also critically depends on understanding its concepts and technical aspects. Training was seen as necessary to this process, but not entirely sufficient, as\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{29}\\) As informed by discussants, having PSEAH officers is mandatory for every IOM mission; however, there is no similar requirement in the case of AAP. Thus, AAP application is mainly being implemented by focal persons."

    "text": "responsibilities and are chosen as AAP focal points based on their educational background, current roles and willingness to assume AAP duties on top of their regular ones.\n\nKey Findings … page 44\n\nRelevance … page 44\nIn Ethiopia, IOM implements operations of significant scale due to the high incidence of migration and displacement in the country, often in close collaboration with national and local authorities. This makes the AAP approaches highly relevant to ensure that affected people contribute to decision-making and are able to raise their concerns directly with the Organization.\nInformants consulted for this evaluation most often recognized AAP approaches as highly relevant to the management and mitigation of operational risks, especially when implemented systematically. AAP systems were deemed effective when able to generate information useful to anticipate, prevent, report and respond to various risk or threats. The implementation of AAP approaches was generally seen as essential to providing human-centred programming in the Ethiopian context, especially in the context of multipurpose cash assistance and non-food item types of interventions. Some informants noted how implementing AAP is “easier” in the context of programmes targeting settled populations (that is, populations residing in “fixed” locations for extended periods, including IDP camps) compared to interventions targeting individuals in transit, where additional challenges are faced (with AAP remaining nonetheless relevant).\nApplication of AAP approaches was also seen as key for functions such as displacement tracking, CCCM and PSEAH. AAP-related indicators were integrated into data collection instruments administered by IOM Ethiopia’s DTM unit. Information is being collected on affected people’s knowledge of available CFMs, preferred CFM usage, preferred information channels and perceived levels of participation in decision-making. As the coordinator of 54 IDP sites in Ethiopia, IOM Ethiopia’s CCCM unit was indicated as important in the implementation of AAP approaches due to the daily interactions of CCCM staff with affected communities.\nIn 2023, IOM Ethiopia’s CCCM unit deployed an automated reporting system for its CFM. This system, called Zite Manager, is used by CCCM help desk officers to collect and register feedback and complaints, which are in turn centrally analysed and shared with the responsible staff in different units for follow-up. This system was perceived as offering various advantages, including easier processing of feedback, strengthened formal communication channels and greater adherence to data protection principles.\nConsulted IOM informants strongly believed that creating spaces and mechanisms for affected community members to come forward and communicate their complaints and challenges is important also for the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse. The absence or weakness of AAP mechanisms was seen as highly detrimental to such prevention. At the same time, the effectiveness of AAP mechanisms in the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse is conditional on the correct understanding, robustness and systematic implementation of those mechanisms, as well as on the extent to which these approaches can address power"

    "text": "Informants highlighted some of the challenges pertaining to the coherence of AAP in IOM Ethiopia. These include inconsistent CFM mechanisms: the Zite Manager solution mentioned above is not used across all programmes and functions and plans to expand its usage have not been implemented due to a lack of resources. Some alternative programme- or project-specific CFMs are in place, and their operation is not necessarily coordinated with the work of the AAP focal persons. A second challenge is that some complaints remain unanswered, either by IOM or by implementing partners, sometimes because complaints may be challenging to address, and other times because addressing them is beyond the capacity or scope of IOM or its partners. An example of the latter is the suspension of food aid by donors in 2023, which was beyond the direct control or influence of IOM Ethiopia. A third challenge noted by informants, this one with respect to the AAP focal persons, is that sometimes AAP activities became secondary to other responsibilities due to workload, directions received from supervisors, or the lack of specific incentives to undertake AAP duties on top of “normal” responsibilities. A fourth challenge observed by informants was the way that some colleagues essentially intend AAP as mere CFM management, without recognizing or engaging with the broader scope and depth of AAP principles and approaches.\n\nInter-Agency Coherence and Coordination … page 47\nThe IAAWG was launched in 2009 by organizations seeking to improve accountability processes. This initiative facilitates inter-agency cooperation and coordination in Ethiopia. The terms of reference were developed in 2013, followed by a memorandum of understanding in 2019. The group operates with rotational leadership and is currently chaired by IOM and cochaired by Plan International.\nThe primary objective of the working group was to achieve horizontal and vertical harmonization among member agencies by standardizing AAP frameworks, indicators and measurement methods. Over time, the working group came to acknowledge that the diversity in AAP frameworks and approaches among member organizations was a value rather than a limitation, shifting its focus to sharing best practices through a community of practice.\nStandardized reporting tools for CFM data have been developed, albeit in manual Microsoft Excel-based formats, with ongoing discussions on how to automate the template for greater efficiency. The consolidated data are analysed using Microsoft’s Power BI to produce the Community Voices report, which is meant to inform planning and decision-making at cluster and humanitarian country team levels. However, less than half of working group members are actively engaging with this initiative.\nCoordination with regard to AAP between IOM and other agencies in the IDP camps settings, where IOM is responsible for CCCM, was also observed to be in place. However, according to informants, only 60 to 70 per cent of all complaints are answered: in some instances, complaints and requests for services are be shared with CCCM staff by community members, but either there is no service provider in the area able to provide the requested service, or service providers present are unable to respond to the complaints."

The way these have been ordered here is not suggesting an “optimal” implementation sequence.

To this end, a revision of the instruction or the release of other types of official statements specifically addressing these doubts should be considered.\nRecommendation 2: The AAP team should develop an operational medium- to longer-term strategy for AAP, to be negotiated at the highest leadership level, with a three-year plan connected to a funding strategy.\nThis recommendation considers findings on the uneven support for AAP among IOM senior management, placing emphasis on the need to have the strategy endorsed at the level of deputy director generals, or even directly by the Director General. The resulting strategy should also be usable as a fundraising tool to attract more resources towards AAP, while also mobilizing core funding to show the Organization’s institutional commitment to AAP.\nRecommendation 3: In conjunction with Recommendation 2 above, the AAP team should develop a theory of change and a dedicated monitoring and evaluation framework for AAP.\nA more structured strategic approach to AAP will require a dedicated and robust framework for its effective monitoring. A new dedicated framework can build from the current existing framework but will need to feature additional indicators (formulated also on the basis of the findings of this evaluation) and, where necessary, improve the formulation of some of the existing outcome indicators.\nThe new framework must not be limited to monitoring, but must also include an evaluation plan that can, at a minimum, include reviews or evaluations at regular intervals, or evaluative exercises focused on specific aspects of AAP or initiatives, considering also impact assessments."

To this end, a revision of the instruction or the release of other types of official statements specifically addressing these doubts should be considered.\nRecommendation 2: The AAP team should develop an operational medium- to longer-term strategy for AAP, to be negotiated at the highest leadership level, with a three-year plan connected to a funding strategy.\nThis recommendation considers findings on the uneven support for AAP among IOM senior management, placing emphasis on the need to have the strategy endorsed at the level of deputy director generals, or even directly by the Director General. The resulting strategy should also be usable as a fundraising tool to attract more resources towards AAP, while also mobilizing core funding to show the Organization’s institutional commitment to AAP.\nRecommendation 3: In conjunction with Recommendation 2 above, the AAP team should develop a theory of change and a dedicated monitoring and evaluation framework for AAP.\nA more structured strategic approach to AAP will require a dedicated and robust framework for its effective monitoring. A new dedicated framework can build from the current existing framework but will need to feature additional indicators (formulated also on the basis of the findings of this evaluation) and, where necessary, improve the formulation of some of the existing outcome indicators.\nThe new framework must not be limited to monitoring, but must also include an evaluation plan that can, at a minimum, include reviews or evaluations at regular intervals, or evaluative exercises focused on specific aspects of AAP or initiatives, considering also impact assessments."

    "text": "direct experience and the availability of dedicated support were also seen as key to real internalization. At the time of the consultations, AAP training courses targeting staff in suboffices were ongoing.\nThe toll-free hotline service - a “milestone” achievement according to some informants - was generally perceived as fundamental to IOM Ethiopia’s core programming and as being effectively maintained. However, some informants pointed to the risk of reducing AAP to mere CFM management, remarking how relying solely on the hotline is insufficient to follow AAP principles in a broader sense.\nAAP indicators have been integrated into monitoring and evaluation tools and activities, and the DTM surveys, to facilitate regular monitoring and assessment processes. However, there is no dedicated theory of change for AAP, nor a consolidated and comprehensive monitoring framework. Additionally, as mentioned already, some informants lamented the absence of “deeper” assessments into the quality and effectiveness of AAP-related activities.\nMost of the mainstreaming efforts are managed by focal persons at different levels. Responsibilities associated with AAP in most cases are not considered as part of the main role and responsibilities of such focal persons. No evidence was found regarding whether assuming AAP-related responsibilities is recorded in formal documents such as the terms of reference of the staff member’s position.\n\nLessons learned … page 51\nThe integration of AAP indicators in data collection processes, particularly regarding community preferences with regard to information channels, participation modalities and CFMs, has proven to be very effective in advocating for resource allocation to AAP and demonstrating the need to fine-tune AAP activities based on the context. Indeed, these data in Ethiopia have shown that preferences and practices vary widely from region to region, with significant differences in terms of preferred language, medium, community structures for accountability, trust in international organizations, government officials or other stakeholders, and so on. This integration has informed IOM approaches but has also contributed to ensuring that the IAAWG strategic plan for 2024 was informed by this evidence.\nWhile AAP capacity was initially centralized in the Ethiopia Country Office in Addis Ababa, efforts to train frontline and suboffice staff since 2023 have contributed to creating a common understanding of AAP across the different operations of IOM. These efforts have also led to increases in the perceived value of AAP activities performed by programme staff, as well as to more frequent solicitation for AAP-related support (for example, to conduct assessments, facilitate stakeholder or community trainings, or set up CFM desks during distributions). AAP focal persons in IOM Ethiopia suboffices play a key role in meeting the growing demand for AAP-related support.\nAAP assessments show that beneficiaries often seek information or raise complaints to security or cleaning staff in offices or migrant centres, as they are often easier to approach. The AAP-oriented trainings targeting these staff categories specifically were greatly appreciated."

Survey respondents according to their work location \nSource: Evaluation survey.\n\nCase Studies … page 13\nTwo case studies were conducted as part of the evaluation to provide practical examples from the field regarding the implementation of the AAP Framework. The IOM country offices selected for these case studies were Ethiopia and Türkiye, based on specific criteria. The IOM presence in Ethiopia is one of its largest, including a country office in Addis Ababa, 14 field offices, as well as Migration Response Centres, migration health assessment clinics and transit centres. It has a highly articulated operational and political setup, encompassing both crisis and non-crisis situations. Within IOM, IOM Ethiopia is considered as having a significant or even comprehensive AAP portfolio. IOM Türkiye was selected because Türkiye was one of the “pilot countries” in which the AAP Framework was initially tested. Additionally, IOM Türkiye makes an interesting case because it applied AAP approaches to cross-border operations with Syria in ways that were seen as innovative.\nThe analysis of the case studies followed the same evaluation criteria as the overall exercise. Interview guides for the case studies were adapted from those used in interviews with IOM staff in other regions, to maintain consistency in the investigation of the primary themes. Data collected regarding the case studies were qualitative, obtained through observations, interviews and focus group discussions. These case studies aimed not to generalize experiences but to identify effective and ineffective practices, understand how information was being communicated from IOM Headquarters, and map out lessons learned. The two case studies were valuable because the experiences of those involved in them were in some ways different and in others similar, adding depth and specificity to the global findings. They effectively illustrated the results gathered from global surveys and interviews with IOM staff at various levels (national, regional and global).\n\n\nSampling … page 13\nIn the inception phase, the evaluation examined the views of IOM staff with a key role or a vested interest in AAP to identify crucial informants for primary data collection.

    "text": "framework. There is clear progress in the implementation of AAP within IOM, but any claim of “AAP mainstreaming” within the Organization cannot be reasonably demonstrated.\n\nAt a decentralized level, there are examples of IOM being able to set up articulated systems and initiatives that promote AAP, with tangible effects on operations. However, sustaining and scaling up these initiatives is challenging. AAP implementation at the level of IOM country offices is predominantly undertaken in the context of specific projects or thematic areas. This may often lead to a “fragmented approach” where solutions and activities implemented in one area are not necessarily replicated or extended to other relevant ones. The case of IOM Ethiopia stood out as an important attempt at “institutionalising” AAP in the country office structure, as well as devising a mechanism to fund AAP activities from all ongoing projects in the mission.\nThere are known gaps that reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of activities promoting AAP at a decentralized level. These include a lack of full integration of AAP into the IOM project cycle; a lack of standard solutions and technical resources for the development and management of complaint and feedback mechanism (CFM) systems; a lack of technical resources and support to make full use of data gathered from affected people; and, finally, a lack of capacity to engage with other actors to promote “collective accountability”.\n\nIn conclusion, the evaluation largely confirms the findings from the 2023 MOPAN assessment, while also drawing a more nuanced and detailed picture of how IOM is pursuing its institutional commitments regarding AAP. Nine recommendations are put forward for IOM senior management and for the AAP team, to address the gaps identified:\n\nClarify that the scope and applicability of AAP extends beyond emergency response operations, reinforcing also the message on the mandatory nature of \\(\\mathrm{IN} / 285\\).\nDevelop an operational medium- to longer-term strategy for AAP, to be negotiated at the highest leadership level, with a three-year plan connected to a funding strategy.\nIn conjunction with Recommendation 2 (develop an AAP strategy), develop a theory of change and a dedicated monitoring and evaluation framework for AAP.\nStrengthen central AAP functions, ensuring that the size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters becomes adequate to meet AAP strategic objectives and that there is capacity to proactively support country offices to structure their approach to AAP implementation.\nSupport country offices in developing office-wide approaches to AAP implementation and funding, reducing fragmentation.\nIncrease the visibility of AAP activities, both internally and externally, on the basis of a clear visibility and knowledge management plan."

Different examples of CFM systems of varying complexity and functions were gathered, always in the context of autonomous development. These narrations sometimes pointed at the significant upfront costs of setting up these systems, at how IOM may be incurring these costs multiple times across the different autonomous initiatives, and how these costs remain to date an insurmountable barrier for some smaller projects or country offices to set up “modern” solutions. “IOM needs a systematic approach and structure for CFMs at field offices. Now there are separate, messy systems different across every [country office] and confusion on whether MEAL, Communications, or other function should manage them; confusion on how to use the feedback into and out of the country office and no systematic system to track followups.”\nIOM staff.\nWhile flexibility and autonomy may promote innovation and better adaptation to different contexts, no informant elaborated on or suggested that a structured initiative is in place to map CFM solutions in the Organization, to identify scalable ones, or to identify and disseminate good practice in general. The development of a “standard CFM system” was sometimes mentioned as needed, although with some caveats and scepticism on the possibility of this solution being available in the short or medium term, with the suggestion that the Organization could look also at what other organizations have developed.\nAnother common theme in the responses concerning CFMs was the limited capacity to consolidate CFM data and produce analyses with uses that go beyond the reporting requirements of the specific project that funded the CFM. Most informants felt that data gathered through CFMs were not being fully utilized due to limited incentives or resources to go beyond the reporting requirements, which are very often based on simplistic indicators that merely count the number of complaints received and responded to, without looking at how those complaints are addressed. \\({ }^{18}\\)\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{17}\\) Case studies 1 and 2 provide some details on the CFM systems in use in IOM Türkiye and IOM Ethiopia, and how their use may be limited to specific units or projects within the respective country offices.

The final list included IOM staff at various levels (Headquarters, regional and national), as well as individuals from partner organizations. All interviews with IOM informants in Headquarters were conducted remotely through Zoom and generally lasted between 45 and 60 minutes. For the case studies, the interviews were conducted in person. Government officials and partners at the local level were interviewed for the case studies, in addition to IOM staff and partners in the relevant IOM country offices.\n\n\nFocus Group Discussions … page 12\nFGDs were conducted to facilitate debate, allowing the observation of power dynamics, consensus and disagreements on critical topics of interest.

    "text": "imbalances between humanitarian workers and affected communities. Noting that the awareness of rights and the understanding of how to safeguard against sexual exploitation and abuse is generally on the rise among affected people, AAP mechanisms were perceived as essential to allow instances of sexual abuse and exploitation, suspicious behaviours and situations of feeling unsafe to be effectively reported.\nMigrants and internally displaced individuals in Ethiopia may often display heightened levels of vulnerability, with ample evidence being available of abuses and human rights violations being perpetrated against members of these groups, both within and outside of the country. Informants perceived the implementation of AAP approaches as potentially relevant also for preventing human rights violations. For example, the hotline provides a channel for community members to raise concerns and issues related to human rights violations.\nCross-Cutting Issues (Gender, Disability) Within the protection unit of IOM Ethiopia, a dedicated team oversees PSEAH, gender and disability concerns; AAP staff work very closely with this team. For example, all AAP training courses are coordinated and organized jointly so as to include AAP and PSEAH material together and have trainers from both teams. The disability inclusion specialist is regularly invited to provide inputs during AAP-related events. As the co-chair of the IAAWG, IOM also closely engages with the Gender in Humanitarian Action Working Group, the disability inclusion expert in the protection cluster and the coordinator of the PSEAH network for contribution to strategic planning.\nIn CCCM settings, women undergo leadership training to enhance their community engagement and decision-making roles. Reportedly, they have a strong representation in community committees, with a growing community acceptance of a 50 per cent women quota, actively facilitating information dissemination, complaints submissions and beneficiary targeting. Additionally, criteria like pregnancy, breastfeeding, and disability are heavily considered in beneficiary selection, as women representatives advocated for their rights, leading to increased female involvement in previously male-dominated roles, such as shortterm jobs and cleaning activities.\nIOM staff and partners recognized the importance of conducting separate consultations with women, to better understand their perspectives and provide them with a safe space to share personal insights. Adjustments to shelter designs and improvements in sanitation (soap and other cleaning materials) have been made, based on such consultations. This is especially important because in some cases women’s feedback has not been taken seriously by organizations that operate in IDP sites. For instance, women in an IDP camp in Tigray who participated in focus group discussions highlighted issues with menstrual hygiene materials, stating that they were provided with reusable sanitary pads instead of disposable ones, creating challenges in camp settings due to the scarcity of water and the discomfort of washing such personal items in crowded shelters. Additionally, efforts were underway to raise resources to hire female hotline operators to facilitate discussions on gender-sensitive issues, such as GBV."

    "text": "Protection, PSEAH, and AAP when interacting with vulnerable groups.” Ultimately, many informants attributed these challenges to the “projectized” nature of IOM, where individual initiatives proceed in a more or less autonomous manner.\nInformants located in field offices also noted that different policies and thematic initiatives in IOM are, de facto, in competition with each other, as the resources and staff time available for their implementation may often be severely constrained. More or less deliberate trade-offs have to be made concerning different policies, noting also how support coming from IOM Headquarters is generally specific to a single initiative or theme, ignoring the interrelationships with other frameworks.\nA lack of coherence between AAP and the Data Protection Policy was mentioned by informants: obstacles to sharing AAP data (because such data include personal information) were noted in some cases, and a lack of support for the definition of data sharing agreements was noted in others. While the merit of these perceptions could not be verified as a technical analysis of the coherence between the AAP Framework and the Data Protection Policy goes beyond the scope of this evaluation, this instance is presented as an example of frameworks that may not have been fully coordinated in their development and in their implementation, for the further consideration of technical experts in IOM.\nFinding 2.2. There are instances where IOM promoted or supported collective accountability through its AAP initiatives, but there are also instances where coordination or collaboration with other actors was lacking. “Collective accountability” emerged as a central theme in the narrations of the informants and is an area where there may be an unmet demand for additional guidance, support and monitoring.\nIn Ethiopia, a joint platform exists where United Nations agencies and various organizations involved in the AAP working group can input data for shared use amidst the ongoing crisis. In this context, the IOM Ethiopia Chief of Mission provided direct reports to the United Nations Country Team on the feedback from affected people (see Case study 1). An additional significant case shared was the Response for Venezuela coordination platform, created by the Office of the Special Envoy for the Venezuela Response, with IOM acting as inter-agency AAP coordinator since 2021. According to IOM informants, the platform was crucial in orchestrating efforts across South America to assist Venezuelan migrants. In both examples, unified platforms were created for agencies to use AAP data collectively and conduct shared initiatives (such as AAP-related training courses), with perceived benefits to coherence and efficiency.\nAt the same time, informants also indicated the presence of significant obstacles and missed opportunities related to collaboration with other United Nations agencies and other organizations in terms of AAP. Almost all informants based in field locations that were consulted for this evaluation mentioned how, very often, feedback collected through CFMs cannot be fully acted upon by IOM alone, lamenting also the lack of a collective accountability approach by which different humanitarian and development actors could provide a coordinated and consolidated response to the issues raised. Informants noted that the fragmentation of AAP systems (across separate organizations) sometimes means that multiple"

Are IOM’s resource allocations appropriate to support IOM institutionalization and operationalization of AAP approach and related evolving international requirements? Are the specific resources allocated to AAP managed efficiently?\nEQ18. Are the systems in place to support IOM offices in fundraising for AAP interventions efficient, adaptive, and cost-effective?\nEQ20. Is IOM efficient in supporting and enhancing staff expertise and development in the field of AAP?\n\nFinding 4.1 The amount of resourcing allocated to AAP is inadequate to pursue institutional objectives, and the funding of AAP is not approached in strategic terms. The size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters increased but remained modest for the workload. \\({ }^{10}\\)\nIOM was found to have implemented a large number of systems for collecting data from affected people. The decentralized structure of IOM was widely recognized by informants as conducive to tailoring AAP approaches to different operational and cultural contexts. Discussions of the diversity of tools used to engage affected people (including SMS, WhatsApp, social media, house visits, complaints boxes, hotlines, calls, surveys, focus group discussions and community engagement projects) emphasized the adaptability of IOM, particularly in challenging environments.\nAt the same time, informants interviewed for this evaluation overwhelmingly felt that the resources currently allocated to AAP in IOM Headquarters are insufficient to meet the demand for support and learning coming from country offices, as well as to drive the development or expansion of relevant guidance and resources. Some informants were frustrated by the absence of an overall funding strategy for AAP to support central AAP structures, noting how advancements often overly relied on the dedication of staffers instead of a structured and sustainable approach. At the country level, informants noted the way that funding for AAP functions often depends entirely on a single project-specific budget, with limited to no use of the (scarce) core resources available to country or regional offices, and rare cases of pooling resources proportionally from different projects (see Case study IOM Ethiopia for an example).\nThe size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters has expanded over time, though it clearly remains disproportionately small when considering the size of the Organization, as well as the fact that AAP is a mandatory aspect of the work of IOM since the formalization of the AAP Framework into IN/285.

    "text": "the selection of pilot countries for exchanges of practices. However, this evaluation found that good practices in the field of AAP were not being identified and disseminated systematically. AAP activities and solutions remain, to a large extent, implemented in isolation, leading to missed opportunities to upscale or synergize with the initiatives of other projects, units or offices.\nFinding 1.3 The role of AAP in promoting cross-cutting themes is considered in the AAP Framework, with practical applications on the ground. The relevance of AAP for environmental sustainability is, however, not considered.\nThe IOM AAP Framework integrates diversity inclusion principles, focusing on vulnerable and marginalized groups, encompassing human rights, gender equality, and disability. IOM staff informants understood and highlighted the importance of AAP for promoting diversity inclusion. The framework specifies groups such as women, children, LGBTQIA+ individuals, the elderly, people with disabilities and ethnic and religious minorities, among others. During field visits in Türkiye and Ethiopia, particular attention was found to be given to women and individuals with disabilities in different AAP initiatives. More generally, the data gathered suggest that IOM employs multiple mechanisms to engage vulnerable populations, offering guidance on reaching out to the most excluded and amplifying the voices of women, youth and other traditionally marginalized groups.\nNumerous instances were identified where women’s specific needs were addressed and individuals with disabilities were included in focus group discussions and other consultation methods. However, environment-related inputs are not included in IN/285; further, AAP activities carried out in country offices that were observed or reviewed did not seem to consider the role of AAP in promoting environmental sustainability.\nFinding 1.4 The “operational” nature of IOM, and its direct interaction with affected people, give it a comparative advantage in the implementation of AAP initiatives. However, the contribution of IOM to AAP has limited visibility.\nConsidering that AAP is a responsibility of the humanitarian and development sector as a whole rather than of single or specific organizations, some evaluation questions asked respondents to explore how IOM contributes to the advancement of AAP from a sectorial and collective perspective. Having a “local focus” and being a “frontline” actor were the most frequently indicated comparative advantages of IOM.\nSeveral informants highlighted the potential of IOM to drive significant advancements in the AAP collective space and to foster “collective accountability”. \\({ }^{11}\\) The Ethiopia case study (Case study 1) illustrates the work done by IOM in this country to provide a platform for the analysis and dissemination of AAP data shared by different actors. However, some informants\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{11}\\) As noted in the IOM APP Framework (IOM, 2020c2), “There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of collective accountability.” However, as that document explains, the term is often used in the context of AAP discussions to indicate that “multiple humanitarian actors are engaged in joint programming, provide common services and pursue collective outcomes”, and that therefore “[a]ll actors involved in such joint efforts are required to ensure AAP obligations and commitments are upheld”. For more, see Finding 2.2 below. In the context of this evaluation, “collective accountability” broadly refers to how AAP should be undertaken jointly by different organizations present in a given operational context, to the extent they are all collectively accountable for their interventions (and the coordination between those interventions) among affected people."

There was a desire expressed for SOPs, standard software applications for CFM management, solutions for the consolidation of AAP data from different sources, guidelines for AAP budget allocations, and guidance on how to engage with different stakeholders. “While I’ve seen the Framework being useful within my field of expertise, more practical and standard tools are needed for day-to-day application. Additionally, developing standard indicators to monitor progress at both project and institutional level is essential.”\nIOM staff.\nTraining provided by IOM Headquarters on IN/285 was appreciated, but there were also frequent calls for more detailed and technical follow-ups on the practical (“how to”) aspects of AAP. As stated by one survey respondent, “Guidance and tools should be much shorter and accessible to facilitate use for people who work extended hours and live under difficult conditions.” Several informants stressed the importance of including concrete examples to illustrate practical AAP applications and benefits. These needs were already known by members of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters, and the creation of a more practical toolkit to fill some of the gaps was underway.\nThe AAP unit in IOM Headquarters effectively disseminated the AAP Framework and established a point of reference within the Organization, despite its relatively small size.

Are there systems in place to document and measure IOM’s global and programmatic performance of the inclusion of AAP principles and commitments in its activities and to record lessons learned and factors affecting IOM’s performance?\n\nFinding 3.1. There are clear indications that the overall volume of AAP activity is increasing in IOM, notably in terms of establishing CFMs and providing information to affected people. Yet the overall progress appears to be limited when considering the size of the Organization.\nAll performance indicators used by IOM to assess progress in AAP have improved (Table 3). The number of offices integrating AAP into the design, planning and implementation of responses, as well as the presence of focal points in inter-agency coordination, achieved values in 2023 that doubled the baseline of 2019. The integration of AAP in country-level crisis response plans also increased substantially. Interview and survey data gathered for this evaluation also indicate that IOM is making greater efforts to inform affected people and establish CFMs (both are pillars of the AAP Framework). \\({ }^{13}\\)\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{12}\\) As well, some informants associated conducting multiple consultations with the formation of unrealistic expectations among affected people. \\({ }^{13}\\) As will be further elaborated in the subsection to follow on efficiency, qualitative findings also highlighted numerous operational challenges and difficulties in using the feedback gathered through CFMs."

    "text": "Not all informants consulted in IOM Türkiye were aware that IN/285 is mandatory in the Organization, with some reducing AAP to the mere management of CFMs. As with other crosscutting internal policies, the adoption and coherent management of AAP was perceived as challenging. In addition to the fragmentation mentioned above, informants noted as challenging the lack of global guidance concerning CFMs, including on the legal and practical aspects of their operation and data management and usage. At a more general level, informants identified the “projectized” nature of the IOM funding structure, and the insufficient availability of resources for mainstreaming policies (never mind the resources to establish and manage systems that work across the Organization), as a fundamental challenge.\nIn some ways, IOM Türkiye reflected the challenges and overall situation regarding AAP in IOM Headquarters, where the ongoing restructuring and unclear repositioning of the AAP portfolio were causing uncertainty and limiting coordination and implementation capacity around these matters. The lack of a comprehensive response to AAP was felt against the backdrop of a growing awareness of this framework and its relevance, although some informants doubted whether the level of awareness of the senior management of IOM Türkiye on global AAP policy was adequate.\nCollaboration on AAP between IOM and other organizations was observed to be limited, as IOM was perceived as working more autonomously than other United Nations agencies. The awareness of governmental partners of AAP was not assessed specifically, but it was observed that CFMs and community engagement initiatives led by local government agencies were in place; there was, however, no clear connection between these initiatives and the IOM ones. Some informants noted that, initially, government agencies did not seem to understand the value of engaging with communities, but that their attitude changed after activities in community spaces were completed and started bearing fruits.\n\nEffectiveness … page 56\nAs already described, at the time of this evaluation, there was a monitoring and evaluation system in place for cross-border operations in IOM Türkiye, as many activities were carried out by implementing partners and not directly by IOM. Some informants perceived this system as costly and of uncommon scale for IOM standards. Monitoring and evaluation data and findings, including from the CFM, were recognized as useful to inform adjustments to programming, but not necessarily sufficient to inform strategic decisions or organizational change in a broader sense. Some informants also perceived that the data gathered were not being fully utilized.\nThe multilingual hotline deployed for the refugee response programme was relatively new, and potential users were being targeted by communications to inform them of this service. Some informants mentioned that complaints and concerns were often received by field staff directly rather than through dedicated communication channels, explaining that this was happening because IOM staff were generally perceived by beneficiaries as open and supportive. Some challenges with the management of the CFM were mentioned, often in relation to translating feedback into concrete adjustments or learning. In the words of one survey respondent from Türkiye, “Complaint and feedback mechanism remain a challenge on how to use these successfully.”"

However, some findings point at how the “fragmented” funding approach based on individual projects (and the uncertainties that come with that) may be creating inefficiencies, especially in terms of duplication when developing and managing CFMs (a domain of AAP on which an urgent need for institutional guidance and resources was often voiced). These narratives stress the importance of greater communication and collaboration on AAP between different projects, technical areas and implementing units, establishing wherever there are possible office-wide approaches to AAP.\nAssessing the impact of AAP initiatives goes beyond the scope of this evaluation and its methodological design. It is, however, hoped that these findings might help identify cases that can be the subject of robust impact assessments in the future.\nThe release of IN/285 was a milestone achievement for IOM engagement with AAP. By providing a legal foundation for the IOM commitment to AAP, this document is one of the pillars for the sustainability of IOM AAP engagement. Active participation in the IASC on AAP was largely perceived to have brought benefits in terms of resource mobilization and awareness, leading to the conclusion that this engagement should not dwindle. Moreover, there are clear signs that AAP principles and values are penetrating IOM “corporate culture”, with more and more staff understanding the need for and advantages of accountability, including important aspects of it such as meaningful community engagement and robust CFMs. Conversely, uneven support for AAP among the senior management of the Organization (with a gap noted in IOM Headquarters leadership), the inadequate resources allocated to AAP, as well as the absence of a clear strategic approach to AAP funding and implementation (at both central and country office levels), all cast a shadow over the sustainability of AAP, with the risk of increasing perceptions that IOM commitments on this matter remain more aspirational than real."

This was perceived as a positive development, with consequences such as more effective service provision and more accessible camp infrastructure. Additionally, the integration of disability-related considerations into monitoring tools was ongoing, reflecting a commitment to strengthening inclusiveness and responsiveness. However, as visible disabilities were perceived as receiving relatively more attention, challenges were acknowledged in addressing less visible forms of disability. For instance, at the time of data collection, there were no operational mechanisms for information sharing for people with a hearing impairment, including no CFM adapted for the hearing impaired. Hotline services, in particular, may be impractical for individuals with such disabilities. Intellectual disabilities were also mentioned as something to be considered in relation to increasing the accessibility of communication material and CFMs.\n\nCoherence and Integration … page 46\n\nCoherence and coordination within IOM … page 46\nConsultations held as part of this case study suggest that IOM Ethiopia has been implementing AAP approaches for some time, although not always labelling these initiatives as AAP. For example, engaging members of affected communities through the establishment of camp committees or through information sharing was a common feature in different interventions even before the formalization of AAP approaches within the country office.\nThe adoption of the comprehensive AAP Framework in IOM Ethiopia sought to formalize and systematize the various ongoing AAP-related initiatives, and also to increase their effectiveness. An example is the collection and processing of complaints and feedback, which was initially conducted with different solutions and approaches by different units or projects. The Zite Manager application was developed specifically for harmonizing complaints and feedback collection practices within CCCM functions, by providing a single solution. This application was perceived as having significantly enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of these processes.\nTo ensure coherence across programmes, IOM Ethiopia mandated training on AAP and PSEAH for all staff. \\({ }^{27}\\) Collaborative training by PSEAH officers and the AAP teams avoids misconceptions about separate CFM systems. The handling of PSEAH-related reports follows specific procedures, and all IOM staff with whom a PSEAH-related allegation is shared, including hotline operators, are expected to report these directly on the institutional We Are All In reporting platform, regardless of how the report was made in the first place (whether directly to the staff member or through an available CFM). In the context of IOM Ethiopia, AAP focal persons follow-up on non-sensitive complaints and focus on the formulation of feedback related to programmes for IOM and partners. In IOM Ethiopia suboffices, AAP focal persons often also serve as PSEAH focal persons, potentially strengthening linkages between the two domains.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{27}\\) This differs from global institutional practice, where AAP training is not mandatory."

In addition, 97 per cent thought that they could channel their suggestion or lodge a complaint if they had one, and 87 per cent of respondents reported that, to their knowledge, suggestions and complaints raised were responded to.\n\nEfficiency … page 49\nMainstreaming AAP into existing programmes is currently achieved through ensuring that each project contributes a certain percentage of the costs of a dedicated staff member and by allocating a specific percentage of the budget from each project to cross-cutting issues, including AAP. This strategy is a good practice that allows the MEAL team to continuously conduct AAP activities. This approach ensures the sustainability of key elements of IOM Ethiopia’s AAP approach, such as the hotline and field staff capacity-building, as well as the ability to respond to programmatic needs and requests. It is to be noted, however, that hotline operators are not on staff contracts, which may jeopardize their willingness to remain with the Organization.\nAAP focal points in suboffices (existing staff members include roles such as the WASH coordinator, the sexual and reproductive health officer, and the protection associate, who are designated as focal persons to oversee AAP initiatives on top of their “regular” responsibilities) are also a key feature of IOM Ethiopia’s AAP approach. These focal persons are chosen in consultation with the heads of suboffices. This arrangement is deemed to be cost effective, as it does not entail additional staff costs, while also yielding significant benefits. The focal persons are able to conduct community, staff and stakeholder training courses, contribute to AAP assessments, and channel, refer and respond to complaints and feedback in line with the expected standards. However, as the AAP-related tasks are added to the focal points’ primary duties, their timely completion relies heavily on available time and the readiness of staff themselves and their direct management to dedicate time for AAP. No system is in place to formally acknowledge achievements or address underperformance concerning AAP-related tasks and responsibilities specifically.\nIn general, the mechanisms available for quality control of AAP activities are insufficient. While the satisfaction of beneficiaries with AAP mechanisms are verified in monitoring and evaluation surveys, there are no “deeper” methods to verify the quality of the response in place, such as recording of calls, or ad hoc verification of referral effectiveness. AAP and CFM operators are not systematically trained in all areas in which they may be required to respond, in order to be able to respond appropriately to diverse beneficiaries and causes for complaint; such areas can include PSEAH, child protection, response to violence towards marginalized or vulnerable groups or psychological first aid. The wellbeing of AAP and frontline staff who are responsible for receiving feedback and complaints is also not systematically monitored.\nThe strategy of assigning AAP responsibilities to staff in different roles is also observed in interagency cooperation. MEAL and information management officers from organizations like IOM, Plan International, and OCHA are often responsible for CFM data management. This is deemed to be efficient in terms of leveraging existing expertise and mainstreaming AAP principles."

These scores will be used to retrieve the most relevant reports for future synthesis work on these mainstreamed themes.\n\n\nCONTEXT\nYou will receive: - Report sections: Key sections extracted from the evaluation report (executive summary, findings, conclusions, recommendations) - All 4 SRF Cross-Cutting Priorities: Each with: - Priority ID and title - Description: The principles IOM commits to mainstreaming across its work\n\n\nBACKGROUND\nThe IOM Strategic Results Framework (SRF) cross-cutting priorities represent principles that should be integrated across ALL IOM programming and operations. Unlike strategic objectives (what IOM delivers) or enablers (organizational capabilities), cross-cutting priorities are lenses through which all work should be designed, implemented, and evaluated.\n\n\nTWO TYPES OF REPORTS\n\nThematic evaluations: The cross-cutting priority itself IS the main subject (e.g., AAP evaluation, gender audit, environmental review)\nProgram evaluations: The cross-cutting priority is a lens for assessing program quality and compliance\n\nYour scoring must capture BOTH patterns.\n\n\nRESPONSE RULES\n\nMUST score all 4 cross-cutting priorities (no omissions)\nMUST use comparative judgment across all priorities simultaneously\nMUST ensure only 1-2 priorities score ≥0.7 (recalibrate if more)\nDO NOT evaluate priorities in isolation\nDO reference specific report sections in your reasoning\nMUST round centrality_score to exactly 2 decimal places\n\n\n\nSCORING TASK\nAssign a centrality score from 0.0 to 1.0 to each cross-cutting priority based on: - For thematic evaluations: How central is this priority as the evaluation subject? - For program evaluations: How substantially is this priority used as an evaluative lens?\n\n\nSCORING RUBRIC\n0.9-1.0 (PRIMARY FOCUS) - Thematic evaluation: The priority IS the main evaluation subject (e.g., AAP assessment, PSEA review, gender evaluation) - Program evaluation: This priority is a core evaluation criterion with dedicated evaluation questions - Appears explicitly in report title, stated evaluation objectives, or evaluation questions - Majority of findings and recommendations directly address this theme - The priority’s indicators or sub-components are systematically assessed\n0.7-0.85 (MAJOR COMPONENT) - Thematic evaluation: The priority is a substantial pillar of a broader cross-cutting assessment - Program evaluation: Dedicated sections assess program performance against this priority - Several findings explicitly evaluate alignment with this priority - Multiple recommendations address strengthening this dimension\n0.5-0.65 (SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT) - The priority is clearly addressed but not a primary evaluation criterion - Appears in 2-3 sections with moderate analysis - Some findings assess compliance; perhaps 1 recommendation relates to it - Recognized as relevant but not systematically evaluated\n0.3-0.45 (MENTIONED/TANGENTIAL) - The priority is referenced but not used as an evaluative lens - Appears descriptively or as aspirational framing - Limited assessment of actual performance against this priority\n0.0-0.25 (MINIMAL/ABSENT) - Brief mentions only, or not present - No substantive evaluation against this priority\n\n\nREASONING STEPS\nFor each priority scoring ≥0.5, follow this process:\n\nIdentify report type: Is this a thematic evaluation of the priority itself, or a program evaluation using the priority as an evaluative lens?\nAssess evaluative presence: Is the priority used to judge program quality, or merely mentioned descriptively?\nCheck structural presence: Does it appear in evaluation criteria, findings on effectiveness/relevance, or recommendations?\nEvaluate depth: Are specific components of this priority (e.g., specific AAP pillars, PSEAH mechanisms, gender markers) assessed?\nAssign score: Based on the rubric and comparative context across all 4 priorities\n\nFor priorities scoring &lt;0.5, brief reasoning is sufficient.\n\n\nCALIBRATION GUIDELINE\nOnly 1-2 priorities should score ≥0.7 for a typical report.\nBefore finalizing your scores: 1.

human rights-based, gender- and disability-responsive, as well as an age- and child-sensitive approach.\n\n\nEstablish comprehensive policies and develop partnerships that provide migrants in a situation of vulnerability, regardless of their migration status, with necessary support at all stages of migration, through identification and assistance, as well as protection of their human rights, in particular in cases related to women at risk, children, especially those unaccompanied or separated from their families, members of ethnic and religious minorities, victims of violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, older persons, persons with disabilities, persons who are discriminated against on any basis, indigenous peoples, workers facing exploitation and abuse, domestic workers, victims of trafficking in persons, and migrants subject to exploitation and abuse in the context of smuggling of migrants.\n\n\nDevelop gender-responsive migration policies to address the particular needs and vulnerabilities of migrant women, girls and boys, which may include assistance, health care, psychological and other counselling services, as well as access to justice and effective remedies, especially in cases of sexual and gender-based violence, abuse and exploitation.\n\n\nReview relevant existing labour laws and work conditions to identify and effectively address workplace-related vulnerabilities and abuses of migrant workers at all skills levels, including domestic workers, and those working in the informal economy, in cooperation with relevant stakeholders, particularly the private sector.\n\n\nAccount for migrant children in national child protection systems by establishing robust procedures for the protection of migrant children in relevant legislative, administrative and judicial proceedings and decisions, as well as in all migration policies and programmes that impact children, including consular protection policies and services, as well as cross-border cooperation frameworks, in order to ensure the best interests of the child are appropriately integrated, consistently interpreted and applied in coordination and cooperation with child protection authorities.\n\n\nProtect unaccompanied and separated children at all stages of migration through the establishment of specialized procedures for their identification, referral, care and family reunification, and provide access to health care services, including mental health, education, legal assistance and the right to be heard in administrative and judicial proceedings, including by swiftly appointing a competent and impartial legal guardian, as essential means to address their particular vulnerabilities and discrimination, protect them from all forms of violence, and provide access to sustainable solutions that are in their best interests.\n\n\nEnsure migrants have access to public or affordable independent legal assistance and representation in legal proceedings that affect them, including during any related judicial or administrative hearing, in order to safeguard that all migrants, everywhere, are recognized as persons before the law and that the delivery of justice is impartial and non-discriminatory.\n\n\nDevelop accessible and expedient procedures that facilitate transitions from one status to another and inform migrants of their rights and obligations, so as to prevent migrants from falling into an irregular status in the country of destination, to reduce precariousness of status and related vulnerabilities, as well as to enable individual status assessments for migrants, including for those who have fallen out of regular status, without fear of arbitrary expulsion.\n\n\nBuild on existing practices to facilitate access for migrants in an irregular status to an individual assessment that may lead to regular status, on a case by case basis and with clear and transparent criteria, especially in cases where children, youth and families are involved, as an option to reduce vulnerabilities, as well as for States to ascertain better knowledge of the resident population.\n\n\nApply specific support measures to ensure that migrants caught up in situations of crisis in countries of transit and destination have access to consular protection and humanitarian assistance, including by facilitating cross-border and broader international cooperation, as well as by taking migrant populations into account in crisis preparedness, emergency response and post-crisis action.\n\n\nInvolve local authorities and relevant stakeholders in the identification, referral and assistance of migrants in a situation of vulnerability, including through agreements with national protection bodies, legal aid and service providers, as well as the engagement of mobile response teams, where they exist.\n\n\nDevelop national policies and programmes to improve national responses that address the needs of migrants in situations of vulnerability, including by taking into consideration relevant recommendations of the Global Migration Group Principles and Guidelines, Supported by Practical Guidance, on the Human Rights Protection of Migrants in Vulnerable Situations."

Introduction  ... page 4\n\nIn 2016, the EU and IOM launched the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration, with as overall objective \"To contribute to facilitating orderly, safe, regular and rights-based migration through the facilitation of dignified voluntary return and the implementation of development-focused and sustainable reintegration policies and processes\". The EU-IOM Joint Initiative in the Horn of Africa (JI-HOA) ${ }^{1}$ commenced in March 2017 in the Khartoum Process countries, with a focus on Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan. ${ }^{2}$ The programme was coordinated by a Regional Coordination Unit (RCU) based in the IOM Regional Office for the East and Horn of Africa region (Nairobi, Kenya).\n\nIn accordance with the programme planning, the JI-HoA underwent a Mid-Term Evaluation in 2019 and a Final Independent Evaluation in 2022/2023, covering the 2017-2022 period, conducted by PPMI Group and commissioned by IOM.

    "text": "The complexity of the JI-HoA and the integrated approach, and the fragility of existing systems in the Horn of Africa countries, leads to the conclusion that ownership and sustainability of the programme cannot be expected after five years of implementation. Important progress has been made, but continued support is needed in terms of capacity-building, but also for wider socio-economic development and security in the four countries in general.\nNamely, the vast majority of challenges and barriers to the achievements of the JI-HoA are linked to the context in which it takes place, and to external factors. Capacity-building efforts were undermined by political priorities and staff turnover; referral systems and service provision for migrants and returnees were hindered by a lack of a structure national referral mechanism, well-functioning health and social security systems, and economic support lost value in the face of a deteriorating economic situation and inflation. Activities of the JI were furthermore hindered by civil conflict and security issues. Therefore, the situation of returnees cannot be addressed without simultaneously addressing the wider socio-economic context.\n\n5.2. Recommendations … page 28\nBased on the conclusions of the evaluation, the evaluation team has designed the following recommendations towards migrant protection, return and reintegration programming.\n\nEnhance efforts with national, regional, and local stakeholders to build capacity and ownership (while continuing provision of funding).\n\nThe EU-IOM Joint Initiative has put visible effort in building the capacity of national actors to support return and reintegration. However, political priorities did not always ensure ownership and commitment of governments to take the JI results forward. Additionally, turnover of staff has removed trained staff and therefore undone some of the work of the JI in this regard.\nTwo important steps need to be taken to enhance the capacity and ownership of key stakeholders, which would set the scene for sustainability and impact. Firstly, capacity building should be expanded to a wider scope of persons. This should include the entire relevant organisational departments, ensuring the participation of top and middle management as well as their staff.\nSecondly, capacity alone is not sufficient to ensure impact and sustainability of the work on return and reintegration. Therefore, migrant protection, return and reintegration programming should focus also on enhancing ownership and commitment of stakeholders towards these topics. Possible steps include the gradual integration of MRCs with the relevant public sector organizations, or coownership/management of the MRCs by local governments (along with IOM) where some of the employees are funded by the local government. In addition, the migrant protection, return and reintegration programming should continue to support the integration of return and reintegration into policy documents and development plans\nHowever, sustainability and independent work by governments and stakeholders is not something that should be expected in the near future. Therefore, financial resources from donors will still need to be allocated to governments and stakeholders to implement their policies and services for returnees."

During this phase, the evaluation team focused on specific questions set out in the evaluation grid and focus on the triangulation of the secondary and primary data sources.\n\nTo gather the insights of key stakeholders of the JI, the evaluation team conducted interviews at country-level (led by national experts) and with regional and global stakeholders, IOM staff, and donors (led by the core evaluation team).\n\nEight Inception Interviews were carried out, including four regional IOM staff interviews and four group interviews with the four IOM country teams.\n52 interviews were carried out with 78 stakeholders, including six interviews with regional stakeholders and 46 interviews with 72 national-level stakeholders (in Ethiopia, most interviews were group interviews)\n21 interviews were implemented with 30 IOM staff at national and regional level\n\nTo gather more comprehensive, in-depth qualitative insights on the experiences of the beneficiaries (migrants, returnees, and community members), the evaluation team organized focus group discussions in each country. Four FGDs were held in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Somalia, and one FGD in Djibouti.\nThe final debriefing workshop, focused on dissemination of the findings and conclusions of the evaluation, helped the evaluation team to validate the findings of the evaluation and collect valuable reflections from IOM staff. The findings from the debriefing were integrated to the final evaluation report.\nThe evaluation was based on numerous consultations with stakeholders and IOM staff, and extensive review of documentation. However, certain external and internal factors influenced the implementation of the evaluation:\n\nThe political and security situation in the programme countries prevented the team from exploring some of the programme implementation localities. In Ethiopia, the Tigray region and Amhara region were deemed not safe to visit, and in Somalia, the FGD in Burao was cancelled due to renewed security/political risks. Similarly, restrictions on travel in Sudan led the team to conduct one online FGD, one FGD where returnees were brought to Khartoum, and one region to be replaced with another FGD in Khartoum.\nNot all selected stakeholders were able or willing to make themselves available for an interview. Fortunately, these only comprised a few stakeholders across the region."

Since returnees are coming back usually “empty-handed”, they are experiencing shame, guilt, and are stigmatised by their communities and relatives. The economic support offered by the JI-HoA not only provides them with resources to start their business but also restores their dignity and self-trust \\({ }^{18}\\).\nIn the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), some returnees pointed out that the overall value of the economic assistance was not enough. \\({ }^{19}\\) This was also confirmed by a stakeholder from Sudan, who suggested that returnees needed more money to satisfy their livelihood during the time of planting, growing and harvesting, since they put most of the microbusiness support into the producing and often have no other sources of income \\({ }^{20}\\).

The high prevalence of CMD among returned migrants from the Middle East was also found in another study \\({ }^{23}\\). This indicates that irregular migrants are much more affected by the CMD compared to people who do not migrate. The specific focus of the JI-HoA on MHPSS therefore addresses key difficulties faced by migrants.\nHowever, in the execution, some gaps were found in the correspondence of specific activities to returnees’ psychosocial needs. The JI-HoA Programme’s Lessons Learned from the Psychosocial Support Component Report noted gaps in the post-return psychosocial support (e.g., lack of MHPSS service, unclear information about compensation of the treatment, high cost, stigma, and low awareness about MHPSS needs among communities) \\({ }^{24}\\).

    "text": "4.2.1. The JI-HoA’s alignment with the objectives and standards of IOM, and objectives of the EU … page 14\nThe EU-IOM JI-HoA aligns with the purpose of IOM as described in its constitution. Providing assistance services for voluntary return migration is a core function of the organisation to ensure safe, orderly and dignified migration \\({ }^{36}\\). IOM’s international norms and standards regarding AVRR are centred around protecting migrants’ rights (to a safe and dignified return) and achieving sustainable reintegration. One of the main principles for IOM regarding AVRR, namely voluntariness, was followed by organizing information sessions of the AVRR programme. \\({ }^{37}\\).\nThe JI-HoA corresponds to the existing EU foreign policy documents and political trajectories. The EUIOM JI-HoA contributed to the objectives of the EU Trust Fund for Africa to emphasise greater economic and employment opportunities and improve migration management in countries of origin and transit. The JI-HoA is also aligned with the Valletta Action Plan, a framework for migration governance between Europe and Africa specifically addressing irregular migration in three regions, including the Horn of Africa, aimed at tackling migrant smugglers, fostering safe return and reintegration, migrant protection and effective governance of irregular migration \\({ }^{38}\\).\nSimilarly, the JI-HoA contributed to the European Agenda on Migration’s objectives, namely the focus on reducing incentives for irregular migration. The objective aims to track and eliminate the causes of irregular migration by developing regional cooperation frameworks, such as the Khartoum Process. A specific objective of the European Agenda, addressed by the JI-HoA, is the improvement of the EU’s return system through the sustainable approach to assisting return migration. \\({ }^{39}\\)\nLastly, while the project countries did not have comprehensive return and reintegration policies in place for the JI-HoA to strengthen/align with, national governments had developed broader strategies such as development plans, poverty reduction strategies and similar documents, to which objectives the JIHoA would also ultimately contribute.\n\n\n4.2.2. Alignment with other initiatives … page 14\nThe analysis of interviews with IOM staff, stakeholders and desk research revealed that IOM put sufficient efforts in mapping activities of different actors in each country to avoid duplication. Therefore, generally there were no duplication across different projects, rather examples of complementary support initiatives.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{36}\\) IOM. (2017). Constitution and Basic Texts.

    "text": "due to the urgency caused by the crisis in Libya, \\({ }^{85}\\) the top-up system was also necessary to widen the scope of the JI-HoA over time. On the other hand, the top-up budgeting system created uncertainties regarding the implementation budget, which hindered planning and budgeting.\nBased on the evaluated material, the human resources were mostly sufficient to meet the programme objectives. The Mid-term Review of the programme stated that there were staff shortages in the JI, and that staff among MRCs was not always distributed efficiently. \\({ }^{86}\\) However, the present evaluation found that improvements were made in the following years to ensure more available and more qualified staff to the programme. There were only a few limitations mentioned in interviews.\nAlthough there were delays in some activities, almost all final results were met by the end of the implementation period of the programme. Note that the initial timeline was amended several times in the course of budget expansion. Beyond financial problems, and the lack of the inception planning, security issues were the major - and most important - reason for delays in Horn of Africa. The security risks remained high for the whole region at the time of the JI-HoA programme and showed a deteriorating trend. \\({ }^{87}\\)\n\n4.4.2. Cost-effectiveness and efficiency of the programme … page 25\nBased on the evaluated materials and the self-assessment of JI-HoA employees, the programme was cost-effective overall, and it also increased the efficiency of some services despite challenges with resource management. As there were not enough resources provided to precisely estimate the distribution of the budget and staff, the following conclusions rest on estimations.\nSome assistance activities for beneficiaries became more efficient during the programme implementation. According to surveys, the return arrangements were better organized, and it became easier to get in touch with IOM for the application of return procedures. The time taken from return to receiving reintegration assistance also decreased, there were less people who had to wait seven or more months in later years. However, the waiting time for the response on return application fluctuated during the implementation. The delays in services could have been due to the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the instable security situation. The war in Tigray region in Northern Ethiopia broke out in 2020, which affected the capacity of the state of Ethiopia to support their citizens to return home.\nBased on the evaluated material it can be concluded that although the JI-HoA was effective in forming partnerships with service providers, additional measures are needed to ensure the stability and financial independence of these actors to increase the efficiency gains created. To decrease costs, partners were expected to complement JI-HoA services without any support or to take over activities and become self-sustaining. However, lack of resources, unstable states, government turnover and the lack of service providers in certain regions made the full reliance on partnerships impossible.\nNational referral systems were established in all countries, but they did not become fully effective and sustainable. This was mainly due to the lack of independent capacity in the region. The effective functioning of referral systems would have enabled IOM to hand over more services to state\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{85}\\) Mid-Term Review of EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration in the Horn of Africa \\({ }^{86}\\) Mid-Term Review of EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration in the Horn of Africa \\({ }^{87}\\) JI HoA Interim Narrative Report #1 and #4 to the European Union"

The RSI was further adjusted based on literature reviews, which resulted in an enhanced version of the institutional questionnaire, called RSS+. \\({ }^{84}\\)\nHowever, the methodology to assess the sustainability of reintegration is rather new and still subject to testing and improvement. Therefore, adjustments in measuring reintegration sustainability were made during the IMPACT study, considering the score threshold.

Using the former approach, \\(92 \\%\\) of the respondents recorded a score higher than the 0.5 threshold.

    "text": "However, the presence of a dedicated AAP adviser or coordinator supporting the IAAWG and its co-chairs is seen as essential to ensure coherence and maintain momentum in AAP implementation. The role requires significant technical expertise and coordination capacity. At the time of the evaluation, while an AAP adviser had been made available through stand-by partner agreements with IOM (in 2023) and OCHA (in 2024), no sustainable funding mechanism was in place to ensure the continuation of this role, putting in potential jeopardy the progress made in the previous years.\n\nImpact and Results … page 50\nThe toll-free hotline service established by IOM Ethiopia was perceived as a valuable resource. DTM teams have been informing communities of the hotline service, increasing the volume of calls. The fact that the service is toll free was also seen as important to facilitate access by affected people. The Community Voices dashboard is seen as an important achievement as it makes analysed CFM data available to a wide range of stakeholders, including civil society. This is done with the intent of informing decision-making.\nWhile a proper impact assessment is outside the scope of this evaluation and case study, examples were provided of how AAP implementation led to changes in assistance provision, including administrative measures such as staff dismissals or partnership discontinuations due to misconduct. In one case, community complaints regarding discrepancies in cash assistance due to currency exchange rate variations from United States dollars to Ethiopian birr led IOM to a change in the conversion method, to ensure that cash grant amounts are based on the latest exchange rate. In another, reports of food aid diversion made by affected people prompted the establishment of a dedicated task force to investigate the reports and take action. The integration and application of AAP within the food cluster was also perceived as impactful.\n\n\nSustainability … page 50\nThe systematic integration of AAP into projects (“mainstreaming”) requires that AAP components are included from the design stage and that budgets allocate resources specifically to AAP. As mentioned already, projects developed by IOM Ethiopia do often include a dedicated AAP budget allocation, and AAP is integrated into projects’ narratives. This is not formally required in IOM at large but only recommended. As a result, the mainstreaming of AAP in IOM Ethiopia’s programming remains subject to mission decisions and priorities, notwithstanding the fact that this country office made a significant effort and dedicated significant resources to AAP. Some informants pointed out how AAP is still not prioritized as it should be in project design and implementation. One informant stated that, in a situation where stringent budget constraints are faced, AAP is highly likely to be the first thing to be sacrificed. \\({ }^{29}\\)\nAAP implementation success also critically depends on understanding its concepts and technical aspects. Training was seen as necessary to this process, but not entirely sufficient, as\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{29}\\) As informed by discussants, having PSEAH officers is mandatory for every IOM mission; however, there is no similar requirement in the case of AAP. Thus, AAP application is mainly being implemented by focal persons."

    "text": "responsibilities and are chosen as AAP focal points based on their educational background, current roles and willingness to assume AAP duties on top of their regular ones.\n\nKey Findings … page 44\n\nRelevance … page 44\nIn Ethiopia, IOM implements operations of significant scale due to the high incidence of migration and displacement in the country, often in close collaboration with national and local authorities. This makes the AAP approaches highly relevant to ensure that affected people contribute to decision-making and are able to raise their concerns directly with the Organization.\nInformants consulted for this evaluation most often recognized AAP approaches as highly relevant to the management and mitigation of operational risks, especially when implemented systematically. AAP systems were deemed effective when able to generate information useful to anticipate, prevent, report and respond to various risk or threats. The implementation of AAP approaches was generally seen as essential to providing human-centred programming in the Ethiopian context, especially in the context of multipurpose cash assistance and non-food item types of interventions. Some informants noted how implementing AAP is “easier” in the context of programmes targeting settled populations (that is, populations residing in “fixed” locations for extended periods, including IDP camps) compared to interventions targeting individuals in transit, where additional challenges are faced (with AAP remaining nonetheless relevant).\nApplication of AAP approaches was also seen as key for functions such as displacement tracking, CCCM and PSEAH. AAP-related indicators were integrated into data collection instruments administered by IOM Ethiopia’s DTM unit. Information is being collected on affected people’s knowledge of available CFMs, preferred CFM usage, preferred information channels and perceived levels of participation in decision-making. As the coordinator of 54 IDP sites in Ethiopia, IOM Ethiopia’s CCCM unit was indicated as important in the implementation of AAP approaches due to the daily interactions of CCCM staff with affected communities.\nIn 2023, IOM Ethiopia’s CCCM unit deployed an automated reporting system for its CFM. This system, called Zite Manager, is used by CCCM help desk officers to collect and register feedback and complaints, which are in turn centrally analysed and shared with the responsible staff in different units for follow-up. This system was perceived as offering various advantages, including easier processing of feedback, strengthened formal communication channels and greater adherence to data protection principles.\nConsulted IOM informants strongly believed that creating spaces and mechanisms for affected community members to come forward and communicate their complaints and challenges is important also for the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse. The absence or weakness of AAP mechanisms was seen as highly detrimental to such prevention. At the same time, the effectiveness of AAP mechanisms in the prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse is conditional on the correct understanding, robustness and systematic implementation of those mechanisms, as well as on the extent to which these approaches can address power"

    "text": "Informants highlighted some of the challenges pertaining to the coherence of AAP in IOM Ethiopia. These include inconsistent CFM mechanisms: the Zite Manager solution mentioned above is not used across all programmes and functions and plans to expand its usage have not been implemented due to a lack of resources. Some alternative programme- or project-specific CFMs are in place, and their operation is not necessarily coordinated with the work of the AAP focal persons. A second challenge is that some complaints remain unanswered, either by IOM or by implementing partners, sometimes because complaints may be challenging to address, and other times because addressing them is beyond the capacity or scope of IOM or its partners. An example of the latter is the suspension of food aid by donors in 2023, which was beyond the direct control or influence of IOM Ethiopia. A third challenge noted by informants, this one with respect to the AAP focal persons, is that sometimes AAP activities became secondary to other responsibilities due to workload, directions received from supervisors, or the lack of specific incentives to undertake AAP duties on top of “normal” responsibilities. A fourth challenge observed by informants was the way that some colleagues essentially intend AAP as mere CFM management, without recognizing or engaging with the broader scope and depth of AAP principles and approaches.\n\nInter-Agency Coherence and Coordination … page 47\nThe IAAWG was launched in 2009 by organizations seeking to improve accountability processes. This initiative facilitates inter-agency cooperation and coordination in Ethiopia. The terms of reference were developed in 2013, followed by a memorandum of understanding in 2019. The group operates with rotational leadership and is currently chaired by IOM and cochaired by Plan International.\nThe primary objective of the working group was to achieve horizontal and vertical harmonization among member agencies by standardizing AAP frameworks, indicators and measurement methods. Over time, the working group came to acknowledge that the diversity in AAP frameworks and approaches among member organizations was a value rather than a limitation, shifting its focus to sharing best practices through a community of practice.\nStandardized reporting tools for CFM data have been developed, albeit in manual Microsoft Excel-based formats, with ongoing discussions on how to automate the template for greater efficiency. The consolidated data are analysed using Microsoft’s Power BI to produce the Community Voices report, which is meant to inform planning and decision-making at cluster and humanitarian country team levels. However, less than half of working group members are actively engaging with this initiative.\nCoordination with regard to AAP between IOM and other agencies in the IDP camps settings, where IOM is responsible for CCCM, was also observed to be in place. However, according to informants, only 60 to 70 per cent of all complaints are answered: in some instances, complaints and requests for services are be shared with CCCM staff by community members, but either there is no service provider in the area able to provide the requested service, or service providers present are unable to respond to the complaints."

    "text": "direct experience and the availability of dedicated support were also seen as key to real internalization. At the time of the consultations, AAP training courses targeting staff in suboffices were ongoing.\nThe toll-free hotline service - a “milestone” achievement according to some informants - was generally perceived as fundamental to IOM Ethiopia’s core programming and as being effectively maintained. However, some informants pointed to the risk of reducing AAP to mere CFM management, remarking how relying solely on the hotline is insufficient to follow AAP principles in a broader sense.\nAAP indicators have been integrated into monitoring and evaluation tools and activities, and the DTM surveys, to facilitate regular monitoring and assessment processes. However, there is no dedicated theory of change for AAP, nor a consolidated and comprehensive monitoring framework. Additionally, as mentioned already, some informants lamented the absence of “deeper” assessments into the quality and effectiveness of AAP-related activities.\nMost of the mainstreaming efforts are managed by focal persons at different levels. Responsibilities associated with AAP in most cases are not considered as part of the main role and responsibilities of such focal persons. No evidence was found regarding whether assuming AAP-related responsibilities is recorded in formal documents such as the terms of reference of the staff member’s position.\n\nLessons learned … page 51\nThe integration of AAP indicators in data collection processes, particularly regarding community preferences with regard to information channels, participation modalities and CFMs, has proven to be very effective in advocating for resource allocation to AAP and demonstrating the need to fine-tune AAP activities based on the context. Indeed, these data in Ethiopia have shown that preferences and practices vary widely from region to region, with significant differences in terms of preferred language, medium, community structures for accountability, trust in international organizations, government officials or other stakeholders, and so on. This integration has informed IOM approaches but has also contributed to ensuring that the IAAWG strategic plan for 2024 was informed by this evidence.\nWhile AAP capacity was initially centralized in the Ethiopia Country Office in Addis Ababa, efforts to train frontline and suboffice staff since 2023 have contributed to creating a common understanding of AAP across the different operations of IOM. These efforts have also led to increases in the perceived value of AAP activities performed by programme staff, as well as to more frequent solicitation for AAP-related support (for example, to conduct assessments, facilitate stakeholder or community trainings, or set up CFM desks during distributions). AAP focal persons in IOM Ethiopia suboffices play a key role in meeting the growing demand for AAP-related support.\nAAP assessments show that beneficiaries often seek information or raise complaints to security or cleaning staff in offices or migrant centres, as they are often easier to approach. The AAP-oriented trainings targeting these staff categories specifically were greatly appreciated."

Survey respondents according to their work location \nSource: Evaluation survey.\n\nCase Studies … page 13\nTwo case studies were conducted as part of the evaluation to provide practical examples from the field regarding the implementation of the AAP Framework. The IOM country offices selected for these case studies were Ethiopia and Türkiye, based on specific criteria. The IOM presence in Ethiopia is one of its largest, including a country office in Addis Ababa, 14 field offices, as well as Migration Response Centres, migration health assessment clinics and transit centres. It has a highly articulated operational and political setup, encompassing both crisis and non-crisis situations. Within IOM, IOM Ethiopia is considered as having a significant or even comprehensive AAP portfolio. IOM Türkiye was selected because Türkiye was one of the “pilot countries” in which the AAP Framework was initially tested. Additionally, IOM Türkiye makes an interesting case because it applied AAP approaches to cross-border operations with Syria in ways that were seen as innovative.\nThe analysis of the case studies followed the same evaluation criteria as the overall exercise. Interview guides for the case studies were adapted from those used in interviews with IOM staff in other regions, to maintain consistency in the investigation of the primary themes. Data collected regarding the case studies were qualitative, obtained through observations, interviews and focus group discussions. These case studies aimed not to generalize experiences but to identify effective and ineffective practices, understand how information was being communicated from IOM Headquarters, and map out lessons learned. The two case studies were valuable because the experiences of those involved in them were in some ways different and in others similar, adding depth and specificity to the global findings. They effectively illustrated the results gathered from global surveys and interviews with IOM staff at various levels (national, regional and global).\n\n\nSampling … page 13\nIn the inception phase, the evaluation examined the views of IOM staff with a key role or a vested interest in AAP to identify crucial informants for primary data collection.

    "text": "framework. There is clear progress in the implementation of AAP within IOM, but any claim of “AAP mainstreaming” within the Organization cannot be reasonably demonstrated.\n\nAt a decentralized level, there are examples of IOM being able to set up articulated systems and initiatives that promote AAP, with tangible effects on operations. However, sustaining and scaling up these initiatives is challenging. AAP implementation at the level of IOM country offices is predominantly undertaken in the context of specific projects or thematic areas. This may often lead to a “fragmented approach” where solutions and activities implemented in one area are not necessarily replicated or extended to other relevant ones. The case of IOM Ethiopia stood out as an important attempt at “institutionalising” AAP in the country office structure, as well as devising a mechanism to fund AAP activities from all ongoing projects in the mission.\nThere are known gaps that reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of activities promoting AAP at a decentralized level. These include a lack of full integration of AAP into the IOM project cycle; a lack of standard solutions and technical resources for the development and management of complaint and feedback mechanism (CFM) systems; a lack of technical resources and support to make full use of data gathered from affected people; and, finally, a lack of capacity to engage with other actors to promote “collective accountability”.\n\nIn conclusion, the evaluation largely confirms the findings from the 2023 MOPAN assessment, while also drawing a more nuanced and detailed picture of how IOM is pursuing its institutional commitments regarding AAP. Nine recommendations are put forward for IOM senior management and for the AAP team, to address the gaps identified:\n\nClarify that the scope and applicability of AAP extends beyond emergency response operations, reinforcing also the message on the mandatory nature of \\(\\mathrm{IN} / 285\\).\nDevelop an operational medium- to longer-term strategy for AAP, to be negotiated at the highest leadership level, with a three-year plan connected to a funding strategy.\nIn conjunction with Recommendation 2 (develop an AAP strategy), develop a theory of change and a dedicated monitoring and evaluation framework for AAP.\nStrengthen central AAP functions, ensuring that the size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters becomes adequate to meet AAP strategic objectives and that there is capacity to proactively support country offices to structure their approach to AAP implementation.\nSupport country offices in developing office-wide approaches to AAP implementation and funding, reducing fragmentation.\nIncrease the visibility of AAP activities, both internally and externally, on the basis of a clear visibility and knowledge management plan."

Different examples of CFM systems of varying complexity and functions were gathered, always in the context of autonomous development. These narrations sometimes pointed at the significant upfront costs of setting up these systems, at how IOM may be incurring these costs multiple times across the different autonomous initiatives, and how these costs remain to date an insurmountable barrier for some smaller projects or country offices to set up “modern” solutions. “IOM needs a systematic approach and structure for CFMs at field offices. Now there are separate, messy systems different across every [country office] and confusion on whether MEAL, Communications, or other function should manage them; confusion on how to use the feedback into and out of the country office and no systematic system to track followups.”\nIOM staff.\nWhile flexibility and autonomy may promote innovation and better adaptation to different contexts, no informant elaborated on or suggested that a structured initiative is in place to map CFM solutions in the Organization, to identify scalable ones, or to identify and disseminate good practice in general. The development of a “standard CFM system” was sometimes mentioned as needed, although with some caveats and scepticism on the possibility of this solution being available in the short or medium term, with the suggestion that the Organization could look also at what other organizations have developed.\nAnother common theme in the responses concerning CFMs was the limited capacity to consolidate CFM data and produce analyses with uses that go beyond the reporting requirements of the specific project that funded the CFM. Most informants felt that data gathered through CFMs were not being fully utilized due to limited incentives or resources to go beyond the reporting requirements, which are very often based on simplistic indicators that merely count the number of complaints received and responded to, without looking at how those complaints are addressed. \\({ }^{18}\\)\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{17}\\) Case studies 1 and 2 provide some details on the CFM systems in use in IOM Türkiye and IOM Ethiopia, and how their use may be limited to specific units or projects within the respective country offices.

Noting that the awareness of rights and the understanding of how to safeguard against sexual exploitation and abuse is generally on the rise among affected people, AAP mechanisms were perceived as essential to allow instances of sexual abuse and exploitation, suspicious behaviours and situations of feeling unsafe to be effectively reported.\nMigrants and internally displaced individuals in Ethiopia may often display heightened levels of vulnerability, with ample evidence being available of abuses and human rights violations being perpetrated against members of these groups, both within and outside of the country. Informants perceived the implementation of AAP approaches as potentially relevant also for preventing human rights violations. For example, the hotline provides a channel for community members to raise concerns and issues related to human rights violations.\nCross-Cutting Issues (Gender, Disability) Within the protection unit of IOM Ethiopia, a dedicated team oversees PSEAH, gender and disability concerns; AAP staff work very closely with this team. For example, all AAP training courses are coordinated and organized jointly so as to include AAP and PSEAH material together and have trainers from both teams. The disability inclusion specialist is regularly invited to provide inputs during AAP-related events. As the co-chair of the IAAWG, IOM also closely engages with the Gender in Humanitarian Action Working Group, the disability inclusion expert in the protection cluster and the coordinator of the PSEAH network for contribution to strategic planning.\nIn CCCM settings, women undergo leadership training to enhance their community engagement and decision-making roles. Reportedly, they have a strong representation in community committees, with a growing community acceptance of a 50 per cent women quota, actively facilitating information dissemination, complaints submissions and beneficiary targeting. Additionally, criteria like pregnancy, breastfeeding, and disability are heavily considered in beneficiary selection, as women representatives advocated for their rights, leading to increased female involvement in previously male-dominated roles, such as shortterm jobs and cleaning activities.\nIOM staff and partners recognized the importance of conducting separate consultations with women, to better understand their perspectives and provide them with a safe space to share personal insights. Adjustments to shelter designs and improvements in sanitation (soap and other cleaning materials) have been made, based on such consultations. This is especially important because in some cases women’s feedback has not been taken seriously by organizations that operate in IDP sites. For instance, women in an IDP camp in Tigray who participated in focus group discussions highlighted issues with menstrual hygiene materials, stating that they were provided with reusable sanitary pads instead of disposable ones, creating challenges in camp settings due to the scarcity of water and the discomfort of washing such personal items in crowded shelters. Additionally, efforts were underway to raise resources to hire female hotline operators to facilitate discussions on gender-sensitive issues, such as GBV."

    "text": "Protection, PSEAH, and AAP when interacting with vulnerable groups.” Ultimately, many informants attributed these challenges to the “projectized” nature of IOM, where individual initiatives proceed in a more or less autonomous manner.\nInformants located in field offices also noted that different policies and thematic initiatives in IOM are, de facto, in competition with each other, as the resources and staff time available for their implementation may often be severely constrained. More or less deliberate trade-offs have to be made concerning different policies, noting also how support coming from IOM Headquarters is generally specific to a single initiative or theme, ignoring the interrelationships with other frameworks.\nA lack of coherence between AAP and the Data Protection Policy was mentioned by informants: obstacles to sharing AAP data (because such data include personal information) were noted in some cases, and a lack of support for the definition of data sharing agreements was noted in others. While the merit of these perceptions could not be verified as a technical analysis of the coherence between the AAP Framework and the Data Protection Policy goes beyond the scope of this evaluation, this instance is presented as an example of frameworks that may not have been fully coordinated in their development and in their implementation, for the further consideration of technical experts in IOM.\nFinding 2.2. There are instances where IOM promoted or supported collective accountability through its AAP initiatives, but there are also instances where coordination or collaboration with other actors was lacking. “Collective accountability” emerged as a central theme in the narrations of the informants and is an area where there may be an unmet demand for additional guidance, support and monitoring.\nIn Ethiopia, a joint platform exists where United Nations agencies and various organizations involved in the AAP working group can input data for shared use amidst the ongoing crisis. In this context, the IOM Ethiopia Chief of Mission provided direct reports to the United Nations Country Team on the feedback from affected people (see Case study 1). An additional significant case shared was the Response for Venezuela coordination platform, created by the Office of the Special Envoy for the Venezuela Response, with IOM acting as inter-agency AAP coordinator since 2021. According to IOM informants, the platform was crucial in orchestrating efforts across South America to assist Venezuelan migrants. In both examples, unified platforms were created for agencies to use AAP data collectively and conduct shared initiatives (such as AAP-related training courses), with perceived benefits to coherence and efficiency.\nAt the same time, informants also indicated the presence of significant obstacles and missed opportunities related to collaboration with other United Nations agencies and other organizations in terms of AAP. Almost all informants based in field locations that were consulted for this evaluation mentioned how, very often, feedback collected through CFMs cannot be fully acted upon by IOM alone, lamenting also the lack of a collective accountability approach by which different humanitarian and development actors could provide a coordinated and consolidated response to the issues raised. Informants noted that the fragmentation of AAP systems (across separate organizations) sometimes means that multiple"

What systems are in place to collect and integrate the views of affected populations in IOM’s work?\nEQ17. Are IOM’s resource allocations appropriate to support IOM institutionalization and operationalization of AAP approach and related evolving international requirements? Are the specific resources allocated to AAP managed efficiently?\nEQ18. Are the systems in place to support IOM offices in fundraising for AAP interventions efficient, adaptive, and cost-effective?\nEQ20. Is IOM efficient in supporting and enhancing staff expertise and development in the field of AAP?\n\nFinding 4.1 The amount of resourcing allocated to AAP is inadequate to pursue institutional objectives, and the funding of AAP is not approached in strategic terms. The size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters increased but remained modest for the workload. \\({ }^{10}\\)\nIOM was found to have implemented a large number of systems for collecting data from affected people. The decentralized structure of IOM was widely recognized by informants as conducive to tailoring AAP approaches to different operational and cultural contexts. Discussions of the diversity of tools used to engage affected people (including SMS, WhatsApp, social media, house visits, complaints boxes, hotlines, calls, surveys, focus group discussions and community engagement projects) emphasized the adaptability of IOM, particularly in challenging environments.\nAt the same time, informants interviewed for this evaluation overwhelmingly felt that the resources currently allocated to AAP in IOM Headquarters are insufficient to meet the demand for support and learning coming from country offices, as well as to drive the development or expansion of relevant guidance and resources. Some informants were frustrated by the absence of an overall funding strategy for AAP to support central AAP structures, noting how advancements often overly relied on the dedication of staffers instead of a structured and sustainable approach. At the country level, informants noted the way that funding for AAP functions often depends entirely on a single project-specific budget, with limited to no use of the (scarce) core resources available to country or regional offices, and rare cases of pooling resources proportionally from different projects (see Case study IOM Ethiopia for an example).\nThe size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters has expanded over time, though it clearly remains disproportionately small when considering the size of the Organization, as well as the fact that AAP is a mandatory aspect of the work of IOM since the formalization of the AAP Framework into IN/285.

However, this evaluation found that good practices in the field of AAP were not being identified and disseminated systematically. AAP activities and solutions remain, to a large extent, implemented in isolation, leading to missed opportunities to upscale or synergize with the initiatives of other projects, units or offices.\nFinding 1.3 The role of AAP in promoting cross-cutting themes is considered in the AAP Framework, with practical applications on the ground. The relevance of AAP for environmental sustainability is, however, not considered.\nThe IOM AAP Framework integrates diversity inclusion principles, focusing on vulnerable and marginalized groups, encompassing human rights, gender equality, and disability. IOM staff informants understood and highlighted the importance of AAP for promoting diversity inclusion. The framework specifies groups such as women, children, LGBTQIA+ individuals, the elderly, people with disabilities and ethnic and religious minorities, among others. During field visits in Türkiye and Ethiopia, particular attention was found to be given to women and individuals with disabilities in different AAP initiatives. More generally, the data gathered suggest that IOM employs multiple mechanisms to engage vulnerable populations, offering guidance on reaching out to the most excluded and amplifying the voices of women, youth and other traditionally marginalized groups.\nNumerous instances were identified where women’s specific needs were addressed and individuals with disabilities were included in focus group discussions and other consultation methods. However, environment-related inputs are not included in IN/285; further, AAP activities carried out in country offices that were observed or reviewed did not seem to consider the role of AAP in promoting environmental sustainability.\nFinding 1.4 The “operational” nature of IOM, and its direct interaction with affected people, give it a comparative advantage in the implementation of AAP initiatives. However, the contribution of IOM to AAP has limited visibility.\nConsidering that AAP is a responsibility of the humanitarian and development sector as a whole rather than of single or specific organizations, some evaluation questions asked respondents to explore how IOM contributes to the advancement of AAP from a sectorial and collective perspective. Having a “local focus” and being a “frontline” actor were the most frequently indicated comparative advantages of IOM.\nSeveral informants highlighted the potential of IOM to drive significant advancements in the AAP collective space and to foster “collective accountability”. \\({ }^{11}\\) The Ethiopia case study (Case study 1) illustrates the work done by IOM in this country to provide a platform for the analysis and dissemination of AAP data shared by different actors. However, some informants\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{11}\\) As noted in the IOM APP Framework (IOM, 2020c2), “There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of collective accountability.” However, as that document explains, the term is often used in the context of AAP discussions to indicate that “multiple humanitarian actors are engaged in joint programming, provide common services and pursue collective outcomes”, and that therefore “[a]ll actors involved in such joint efforts are required to ensure AAP obligations and commitments are upheld”. For more, see Finding 2.2 below. In the context of this evaluation, “collective accountability” broadly refers to how AAP should be undertaken jointly by different organizations present in a given operational context, to the extent they are all collectively accountable for their interventions (and the coordination between those interventions) among affected people."

As part of the desk review conducted for this evaluation, no internal guidance nor technical resources regarding collective accountability (such as legal templates for collaboration or data sharing) were found.

There are clear indications that the overall volume of AAP activity is increasing in IOM, notably in terms of establishing CFMs and providing information to affected people. Yet the overall progress appears to be limited when considering the size of the Organization.\nAll performance indicators used by IOM to assess progress in AAP have improved (Table 3). The number of offices integrating AAP into the design, planning and implementation of responses, as well as the presence of focal points in inter-agency coordination, achieved values in 2023 that doubled the baseline of 2019. The integration of AAP in country-level crisis response plans also increased substantially. Interview and survey data gathered for this evaluation also indicate that IOM is making greater efforts to inform affected people and establish CFMs (both are pillars of the AAP Framework). \\({ }^{13}\\)\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{12}\\) As well, some informants associated conducting multiple consultations with the formation of unrealistic expectations among affected people. \\({ }^{13}\\) As will be further elaborated in the subsection to follow on efficiency, qualitative findings also highlighted numerous operational challenges and difficulties in using the feedback gathered through CFMs."

In addition to the fragmentation mentioned above, informants noted as challenging the lack of global guidance concerning CFMs, including on the legal and practical aspects of their operation and data management and usage. At a more general level, informants identified the “projectized” nature of the IOM funding structure, and the insufficient availability of resources for mainstreaming policies (never mind the resources to establish and manage systems that work across the Organization), as a fundamental challenge.\nIn some ways, IOM Türkiye reflected the challenges and overall situation regarding AAP in IOM Headquarters, where the ongoing restructuring and unclear repositioning of the AAP portfolio were causing uncertainty and limiting coordination and implementation capacity around these matters. The lack of a comprehensive response to AAP was felt against the backdrop of a growing awareness of this framework and its relevance, although some informants doubted whether the level of awareness of the senior management of IOM Türkiye on global AAP policy was adequate.\nCollaboration on AAP between IOM and other organizations was observed to be limited, as IOM was perceived as working more autonomously than other United Nations agencies. The awareness of governmental partners of AAP was not assessed specifically, but it was observed that CFMs and community engagement initiatives led by local government agencies were in place; there was, however, no clear connection between these initiatives and the IOM ones. Some informants noted that, initially, government agencies did not seem to understand the value of engaging with communities, but that their attitude changed after activities in community spaces were completed and started bearing fruits.\n\nEffectiveness … page 56\nAs already described, at the time of this evaluation, there was a monitoring and evaluation system in place for cross-border operations in IOM Türkiye, as many activities were carried out by implementing partners and not directly by IOM. Some informants perceived this system as costly and of uncommon scale for IOM standards. Monitoring and evaluation data and findings, including from the CFM, were recognized as useful to inform adjustments to programming, but not necessarily sufficient to inform strategic decisions or organizational change in a broader sense. Some informants also perceived that the data gathered were not being fully utilized.\nThe multilingual hotline deployed for the refugee response programme was relatively new, and potential users were being targeted by communications to inform them of this service. Some informants mentioned that complaints and concerns were often received by field staff directly rather than through dedicated communication channels, explaining that this was happening because IOM staff were generally perceived by beneficiaries as open and supportive. Some challenges with the management of the CFM were mentioned, often in relation to translating feedback into concrete adjustments or learning. In the words of one survey respondent from Türkiye, “Complaint and feedback mechanism remain a challenge on how to use these successfully.”"

However, some findings point at how the “fragmented” funding approach based on individual projects (and the uncertainties that come with that) may be creating inefficiencies, especially in terms of duplication when developing and managing CFMs (a domain of AAP on which an urgent need for institutional guidance and resources was often voiced). These narratives stress the importance of greater communication and collaboration on AAP between different projects, technical areas and implementing units, establishing wherever there are possible office-wide approaches to AAP.\nAssessing the impact of AAP initiatives goes beyond the scope of this evaluation and its methodological design. It is, however, hoped that these findings might help identify cases that can be the subject of robust impact assessments in the future.\nThe release of IN/285 was a milestone achievement for IOM engagement with AAP. By providing a legal foundation for the IOM commitment to AAP, this document is one of the pillars for the sustainability of IOM AAP engagement. Active participation in the IASC on AAP was largely perceived to have brought benefits in terms of resource mobilization and awareness, leading to the conclusion that this engagement should not dwindle. Moreover, there are clear signs that AAP principles and values are penetrating IOM “corporate culture”, with more and more staff understanding the need for and advantages of accountability, including important aspects of it such as meaningful community engagement and robust CFMs. Conversely, uneven support for AAP among the senior management of the Organization (with a gap noted in IOM Headquarters leadership), the inadequate resources allocated to AAP, as well as the absence of a clear strategic approach to AAP funding and implementation (at both central and country office levels), all cast a shadow over the sustainability of AAP, with the risk of increasing perceptions that IOM commitments on this matter remain more aspirational than real."

This was perceived as a positive development, with consequences such as more effective service provision and more accessible camp infrastructure. Additionally, the integration of disability-related considerations into monitoring tools was ongoing, reflecting a commitment to strengthening inclusiveness and responsiveness. However, as visible disabilities were perceived as receiving relatively more attention, challenges were acknowledged in addressing less visible forms of disability. For instance, at the time of data collection, there were no operational mechanisms for information sharing for people with a hearing impairment, including no CFM adapted for the hearing impaired. Hotline services, in particular, may be impractical for individuals with such disabilities. Intellectual disabilities were also mentioned as something to be considered in relation to increasing the accessibility of communication material and CFMs.\n\nCoherence and Integration … page 46\n\nCoherence and coordination within IOM … page 46\nConsultations held as part of this case study suggest that IOM Ethiopia has been implementing AAP approaches for some time, although not always labelling these initiatives as AAP. For example, engaging members of affected communities through the establishment of camp committees or through information sharing was a common feature in different interventions even before the formalization of AAP approaches within the country office.\nThe adoption of the comprehensive AAP Framework in IOM Ethiopia sought to formalize and systematize the various ongoing AAP-related initiatives, and also to increase their effectiveness. An example is the collection and processing of complaints and feedback, which was initially conducted with different solutions and approaches by different units or projects. The Zite Manager application was developed specifically for harmonizing complaints and feedback collection practices within CCCM functions, by providing a single solution. This application was perceived as having significantly enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of these processes.\nTo ensure coherence across programmes, IOM Ethiopia mandated training on AAP and PSEAH for all staff. \\({ }^{27}\\) Collaborative training by PSEAH officers and the AAP teams avoids misconceptions about separate CFM systems. The handling of PSEAH-related reports follows specific procedures, and all IOM staff with whom a PSEAH-related allegation is shared, including hotline operators, are expected to report these directly on the institutional We Are All In reporting platform, regardless of how the report was made in the first place (whether directly to the staff member or through an available CFM). In the context of IOM Ethiopia, AAP focal persons follow-up on non-sensitive complaints and focus on the formulation of feedback related to programmes for IOM and partners. In IOM Ethiopia suboffices, AAP focal persons often also serve as PSEAH focal persons, potentially strengthening linkages between the two domains.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{27}\\) This differs from global institutional practice, where AAP training is not mandatory."

This strategy is a good practice that allows the MEAL team to continuously conduct AAP activities. This approach ensures the sustainability of key elements of IOM Ethiopia’s AAP approach, such as the hotline and field staff capacity-building, as well as the ability to respond to programmatic needs and requests. It is to be noted, however, that hotline operators are not on staff contracts, which may jeopardize their willingness to remain with the Organization.\nAAP focal points in suboffices (existing staff members include roles such as the WASH coordinator, the sexual and reproductive health officer, and the protection associate, who are designated as focal persons to oversee AAP initiatives on top of their “regular” responsibilities) are also a key feature of IOM Ethiopia’s AAP approach. These focal persons are chosen in consultation with the heads of suboffices. This arrangement is deemed to be cost effective, as it does not entail additional staff costs, while also yielding significant benefits. The focal persons are able to conduct community, staff and stakeholder training courses, contribute to AAP assessments, and channel, refer and respond to complaints and feedback in line with the expected standards. However, as the AAP-related tasks are added to the focal points’ primary duties, their timely completion relies heavily on available time and the readiness of staff themselves and their direct management to dedicate time for AAP. No system is in place to formally acknowledge achievements or address underperformance concerning AAP-related tasks and responsibilities specifically.\nIn general, the mechanisms available for quality control of AAP activities are insufficient. While the satisfaction of beneficiaries with AAP mechanisms are verified in monitoring and evaluation surveys, there are no “deeper” methods to verify the quality of the response in place, such as recording of calls, or ad hoc verification of referral effectiveness. AAP and CFM operators are not systematically trained in all areas in which they may be required to respond, in order to be able to respond appropriately to diverse beneficiaries and causes for complaint; such areas can include PSEAH, child protection, response to violence towards marginalized or vulnerable groups or psychological first aid. The wellbeing of AAP and frontline staff who are responsible for receiving feedback and complaints is also not systematically monitored.\nThe strategy of assigning AAP responsibilities to staff in different roles is also observed in interagency cooperation. MEAL and information management officers from organizations like IOM, Plan International, and OCHA are often responsible for CFM data management. This is deemed to be efficient in terms of leveraging existing expertise and mainstreaming AAP principles."

Print screen of Community Voices, common AAP platform for the international community in Ethiopia\nCommunity Voices, December 2023 The dashboard presents feedback gathered from the community affected by the crisis across Ethiopia. It is designed to help humanitarian responders make decisions and adapt programming by providing insights into what communities are saying as the response progresses. This dashboard is an interagency platform for community engagement and accountability to affected populations in Ethiopia. \nSource: IOM, 2023f. IOM in Ethiopia promotes the participation of affected people by integrating AAP-oriented approaches into regular data collection exercises. It assesses the effectiveness of AAP mechanisms systematically through tools such as post-distribution monitoring and DTM site and village assessments. In 2023, with the support of the Ethiopia Humanitarian Fund, DTM integrated AAP indicators in its Site Assessment Round 34 and Village Assessment Survey Round 17 tools, which assess the mobility, needs and vulnerabilities of IDPs and returning IDPs across Ethiopia. The analysis of these data led to the publication of an AAP snapshot and a presentation to the IAAWG that informed its 2024 strategic plan. Enumerators working with IOM Ethiopia on DTM or MEAL activities are trained on AAP and share the hotline number when needed with affected people.\nAs the co-lead organization for the IAAWG, IOM Ethiopia facilitates regular meetings and knowledge-sharing sessions, as well as maintaining the Community Voices dashboard. In addition, in consultation with IAAWG members, IOM conducted an AAP perception survey to reflect on AAP practices and challenges among humanitarian actors in the country, and to inform the production of information-sharing materials for the working group. Capacitybuilding training on AAP and related topics was provided by IOM MEAL staff to 121 working group partners in 2023.\nEach of the 13 suboffices of IOM Ethiopia have two AAP focal persons who received training (from the central MEAL unit) in AAP implementation and mainstreaming. These focal persons are responsible for liaising with various units in their respective suboffices to ensure that feedback gathered from affected people is addressed. They also support AAP assessments, trainings and community engagement activities such as community committee trainings on AAP, and they document complaints and feedback channels through face-to-face interactions.

    "text": "Examples of programme adaptation triggered by feedback received via the CFMs were provided both in the context of refugee response and cross-border operations. For instance, the schedule of vocational training sessions was changed to allow easier participation by those working regular hours; the expansion or introduction of cash-based interventions in both contexts followed preferences shared by beneficiaries; the introduction of Turkish language courses followed requests from female beneficiaries; and school transportation services were adapted to better serve needs.\nExamples of insufficient or slow adaptation were also gathered. According to some stakeholders consulted, the assistance received from the cross-border programme was not always aligned with the needs of people: for example, food kits were perceived as not relevant but humanitarian programming took a long time to adjust to feedback. The assistance was perceived as following a “pre-planned” model that could not be changed easily (or at all), even if feedback was provided. Local communities were known to complain that livelihood projects were limited, demanding more structural interventions to promote economic development (something not necessarily within the scope of the ongoing interventions). Finally, the limited participation of local councils or community leaders in needs assessments was mentioned, stressing how this can affect the overall efficacy of AAP.\n\nEfficiency … page 57\nData gathered for this case study suggest that there were limited linkages between programme units and monitoring and evaluation functions. Moreover, according to an informant, monitoring and evaluation activities were sometimes left “out of the loop”. The same informant perceived that many colleagues still viewed monitoring and evaluation as an audit process rather than something that facilitates learning and project adaptation. Processes for running AAP mechanisms were generally not perceived as streamlined and a demand for more in-depth and practical AAP training was voiced, as webinars and other “virtual” forms of dissemination were not perceived as sufficient.\nSeveral informants noted that acting on some of the complaints received was more difficult than what it should have been. Answering such complaints sometimes took longer than expected and doubts persisted on what constitutes an efficient channel or solution to manage feedback efficiently. Internal coordination between different teams within IOM was seen as limited, and it was not always clear how to secure resources for concrete follow-up actions, such as sharing vehicles for reaching far away locations for beneficiary visits. Another set of difficulties identified focused on how the ability of beneficiaries to express their concerns and liaise with IOM in order to find solutions was constrained by the beneficiaries’ lack of contextual information, lack of literacy and vulnerability.\nThe limited collaboration between IOM and other United Nations partner agencies mentioned above may have had repercussions on efficiency, as well as on coherence. One informant stated that sometimes the issues raised by beneficiaries went beyond the reach of IOM, and pointed to the difficulty of coordinated responses. The same informant also explained how the lack of coordination is fatiguing for affected people, especially when similar questions are asked by different organizations, and when responses do not follow the questions (“In some"

    "text": "Finding 3.4. The institutional framework for monitoring the implementation of AAP policy is basic and predominantly focuses on outputs rather than outcomes and impacts. The IOM SRF (2024) is commendable in that it shifts its focus towards outcomes, including service and programme satisfaction revised according to feedback from affected people, but there is still a need for a specific and comprehensive monitoring framework for AAP.\nThe monitoring of AAP in IOM is based on indicators included in other institutional monitoring tools rather than having its own dedicated logical framework based on a clear theory of change. The indicators used show that the focus of monitoring activities is predominantly on outputs, with targets not clearly defined and with an unclear distinction between outputs, outcomes and impacts, or objectives.\nIn the IOM Strategic Plan 2024-2028 and the IOM SRF, new AAP indicators have been included (see Annex C) that can enhance reflection on the tangible benefits of AAP. Concerning the identification of good practices, some informants in field offices expressed uncertainty on how “success stories” were identified by IOM Headquarters.\nFinding 3.5. Engagement with and awareness of AAP among senior or leadership officers is unequal, with officers in field offices being more committed to AAP than those in central functions.\nSeveral IOM officers consulted believed that senior leadership was somewhat disengaged from AAP or only marginally attentive to it. This sentiment is also reflected by the resources allocated to AAP activities at the central level, which several informants considered to be inadequate. \\({ }^{14}\\) The limited investment of core funding in AAP - with, at the time of this evaluation, the AAP Coordination Unit primarily being staffed by consultants funded by a specific USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance initiative - is perceived as a sign that implementing AAP is not a top priority for IOM.\nSenior staff consulted in field offices generally appeared to be engaged with and aware of AAP. In the IOM Ethiopia Country Office, for instance, AAP was addressed at the highest organizational level, enabling the appointment of AAP focal points for all suboffices, setting up mechanisms to share data with external partners, and holding discussions with the United Nations Country Team (see Case study 1). Conversely, the engagement of leadership at the headquarters level seemed to be confined to the initial stages, during the design and launch of the AAP Framework. This evaluation attempted to consult senior IOM Headquarters officers on this matter, but interviews did not take place due to the unavailability of the individuals contacted. \\({ }^{15}\\)\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{14}\\) This finding, gathered in 2024, backs up the 2023 MOPAN analysis regarding AAP, which concluded that IOM had not yet been able to consistently incorporate AAP across all its programmes and did not invest adequately in AAP, considering the scale of its operations. \\({ }^{15}\\) The unavailability of senior IOM Headquarters staff to be interviewed for this evaluation was interpreted as a sign of limited engagement on the matter."

As well, it identifies areas where considerable progress has been made or is being made, mainly thanks to the dedication of an undersized central AAP unit, and that of several staffers in country offices who most often undertake AAP initiatives with project-specific funding.\nThe IOM AAP Framework is relevant to the mission of the Organization and consistent with the United Nations system and with IASC policies.

As a result, IN/285 is formally consistent with other relevant IOM policies and guidelines. However, at the operational level, where field staff have to consider multiple policies and organizational priorities, the interlinkages between AAP and other frameworks (such as data protection, for example) are not always explicitly addressed, due to a perceived lack of available guidance, tools and support that address such links. To extend the example of data protection, the practical resources (such as a template for data-sharing agreements) and support are lacking that would be required to ensure that AAP activities oriented towards collective accountability (which sometimes entail sharing the personal data of affected persons, for instance) are undertaken in accordance with data protection principles and standards.\nThe provision of appropriate guidance and tools for practical AAP implementation is an essential aspect that this evaluation considered. Informants overwhelmingly found that IN/285 was valuable in steering IOM efforts in AAP and appreciated the training sessions offered by IOM Headquarters to improve awareness of these requirements (IN/285 established the mandatory nature of AAP in IOM).

    "text": "Informants confirmed that the development of the AAP Framework did not significantly involve Member States. The perspectives of Member States were not sufficiently explored for this evaluation to determine if alignment exists or not. However, IOM informants reported that a total of 225 affected persons, from different countries, participated in the consultation phase of the AAP Framework, prior to its piloting in 2018.\nIOM staff noted during interviews and in the survey that local communities may not always recognize the advantages of feedback mechanisms, or that there may be some cultural barriers to providing feedback. For example, one informant described how, in some contexts in Myanmar, giving negative feedback on assistance received may be avoided so as not to “show lack of gratitude”. Staff attempt to convey that the assistance provided is an entitlement; however, obtaining open and candid feedback may be difficult in such contexts, meaning that any application (and assessment) of AAP needs an awareness of culturally appropriate approaches.\nFinding 1.2. AAP is deemed as having general relevance for IOM, although IN/285 is specific to emergency response contexts. \\({ }^{9}\\) The AAP team has effectively promoted the framework, but there is an unmet demand for translating theoretical guidelines into more practical tools and solutions. Exchange of practical experiences between various field offices.\nThe AAP Framework has a degree of specificity to humanitarian and emergency response operations. This was found to generate confusion about the operational scope of AAP, although AAP principles and approaches were felt to be relevant also for non-emergency contexts. Some informants suggested that the focus of the current AAP Framework could be revised to strengthen connections with the Sustainable Development Goals.\nA distinction should be drawn between the AAP Framework (IN/285) and other guidance and tools available for its “operationalization” (such as the IOM AAP toolkits on participation, (2020a), on information sharing and transparency (2020b), and on CFM (2020d)). Perceptions of the Framework often differed from perceptions of the guidance and tools. Most staff interviewed during KIIs found that the Framework was helpful for defining the role of AAP and its importance for the Organization. In contrast, only half of the respondents to the global survey (Figure 3) rated the usefulness of AAP guidance and tools as very high (17%) or high (29%). Informants often felt that, while IN/285 effectively frames AAP, the tools provided and guidance available for the actual implementation of AAP approaches were not as practical as they should be.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{9}\\) It should be noted that, since 2024, AAP has gained formal relevance across all IOM programming as its oversight was shifted from the Department of Emergencies to the Protection Division. These developments took place during the evaluation period and could not be fully reflected in the findings, but they are relevant to their interpretation."

These perceptions find confirmation from the desk review conducted for this evaluation, which identified only a relatively limited amount of public documentation and externally facing dissemination material on AAP initiatives led by IOM.\n\nCoherence … page 21\nEvaluation questions and themes for the “coherence” criterion:\n\nEQ7. Which mechanisms are in place to guarantee internal coherence for the inclusion of AAP principles and commitment in relevant IOM areas of work?\nEQ8. Does IOM effectively align its AAP interventions with United Nations and IASC AAP related guidance and mechanisms at global, regional, and national levels?\nEQ9. Are IOM AAP principles, mechanism and framework encouraging and reinforcing international and local partnerships for a comprehensive response tailored to the needs of affected populations?\nEQ11. Have IOM AAP Framework initiatives been effective to foster coordination with local and international partners for a better response, tailored to the identified needs of the affected populations?\n\nFinding 2.1. IOM pursues AAP through various frameworks and initiatives that are not always coordinated.\nAt a general level, IOM is widely receptive to the integration of AAP principles and initiatives into its interventions. AAP-related initiatives were being pursued even before AAP was formalized in IN/285, though according to one informant, AAP was probably seen as “good programming” rather than a mandatory requirement.\nAccording to most informants, the idea of actively listening to and engaging with affected people is on the way to becoming fully accepted by IOM staff. This sentiment is exemplified by one chief of mission who stated that “regular consultations are embedded in everything we do.” This finding is supported by interviews with IOM regional and country offices, where the staff consulted reported frequent engagement with affected people before interventions, during programme implementation, in post-assessment surveys, and in community programmes to run local initiatives.\nAccording to many informants - and as also confirmed by the Turkish and Ethiopian case studies - collaboration on the implementation of AAP initiatives, as well as the search for synergies between different projects, units, or departments implementing AAP, appears to be challenging in IOM. Informants interviewed from various regions, particularly those in field offices, highlighted communication challenges within IOM departments and across different thematic initiatives. Despite increasing efforts to enhance connections between AAP and PSEAH, to enhance connections between AAP and the rights-based approach, and to enhance the gathering of AAP data by the DTM unit, difficulties persist. As one informant stated, “IOM thoroughly engages with affected populations, but there is not unity between what is done by"

There were different CFMs in place and their management was primarily considered to be the responsibility of those running monitoring and evaluation processes. Other types of AAP initiatives (for example, information sharing, participation in decision-making and project adaptation) were also being undertaken, with programme teams considered directly responsible for them.\nConsultations conducted for this case study suggest that the available global guidance on AAP had limited influence in shaping the local AAP strategy and work. A need and demand for more specific guidance and tools (SOPs, “off-the-shelf” systems) was voiced: one IOM staff member interviewed said “more guidance on how to operationalize certain activities would be helpful”. Informants confirmed that IOM Türkiye received some support from IOM Headquarters in establishing AAP initiatives. At the same time, IOM Headquarters was seen by an informant as “requesting rather than providing support”, considering the balance between the amount of support available for the implementation of new policies and the requests and expectations from different departments in IOM Headquarters. In the context of the refugee response, the SOP for the cross-border operations CFM was reviewed by IOM Headquarters and the feedback received was deemed to be useful.\nIn terms of whether AAP in IOM Türkiye considered cross-cutting issues, the evaluator observed that special consideration was given to women. Concerning the inclusion of people with disabilities, some interviewees mentioned that visits were being conducted to hear their concerns and suggestions. A senior IOM staff member mentioned that disability was an area of work and concern receiving growing attention in the mission. Focal points for disability were said to have been nominated for some programmes. Conversely, no evidence that consideration was being given to environmental sustainability could be found. \\({ }^{31}\\)\nIn general, most informants did not feel that AAP was a priority for IOM Türkiye, especially as a restructuring of the office entailing a reduction of personnel was ongoing at the time of the consultations. A senior staff member of IOM Türkiye mentioned that expectations from donors in terms of AAP often did not correspond to the resources made available for the implementation of these initiatives and for monitoring and evaluation more generally.\n\n\nCoherence … page 55\nLimited coherence and coordination of AAP activities across different programmes could be observed. Internal reporting lines for AAP differed across different programmes, and were subject to change. AAP initiatives were in some cases perceived as advanced and comprehensive, although also fragmented, with no apparent effort to find synergies between them.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{31}\\) As explained in Finding 1.3, environmental sustainability is never mentioned in IN/285 as one of the cross-cutting themes to which AAP can contribute to."

These entailed 12 KIIs, as well as five FGDs attended by a total of 57 individuals ( 26 women and 31 men). Consultations were conducted in the IOM Ankara Country Office and in the Gaziantep Suboffice.\nTürkiye was selected for a case study following the suggestion of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters, with the intention of focusing on AAP in the context of IOM Türkiye’s crossborder operations with Syria. The evaluator decided to also include in the scope of the consultations AAP-related initiatives undertaken for IOM Türkiye’s refugee response operations, in order to gain a more comprehensive view of AAP in the country office and to see how AAP activities undertaken by the two different programmes interrelated. Additional interviews were also held with programme officers in Ankara not working on either of the two initiatives, to gauge the extent of AAP implementation in other operational domains.\n\n\nTürkiye Context … page 53\nIn IOM Türkiye, at the time of this evaluation, there was a structured CFM specifically set up for the cross-border operations between Türkiye and Syria. This system was managed from the Gaziantep Suboffice by the cross-border programme. Another CFM was set up for the refugee response programme and was led by the monitoring and evaluation unit, also in Gaziantep. The monitoring and evaluation unit and the cross-border programme unit were observed to work quite independently of each other.\nThe monitoring and evaluation system for cross-border operations was designed in a context where implementation relied to a large extent on the implementing partners, and IOM needed an effective system to monitor progress and assess whether or not the programme activities were being executed properly. As illustrated in Figure 8, the monitoring and evaluation system was articulated in three components: a commodity tracking system; third-party monitoring; and AAP. The commodity tracking system applied a unique barcode-based identification number to every single kit delivered to beneficiaries, \\({ }^{30}\\) allowing the beneficiary to confirm whether they received the assistance or not. Third-party monitoring was implemented by Kudra Social Development Solutions, a partner with presence in both Syria and Türkiye (Gaziantep) contracted by IOM to manage beneficiary verification, distribution monitoring and exit interviews, post-distribution monitoring, and satisfaction surveys. A CFM designated as the “Dialogue, Information and Participation System” (DIPS) was established in late 2018. It consisted of a hotline together with mechanisms to share information and collect complaints and feedback via WhatsApp. Figure 8 also refers to “endorsement”: an important responsibility\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{30}\\) According to IOM Türkiye officers, the commodity tracking system tracks the movement of humanitarian supplies from the IOM warehouse in Gaziantep to the intended locations in Syria. The system allows IOM to know that a shipment reached its intended delivery location, and the specific time it did, which strengthens accountability and transparency in all distributions. Every kit released from the IOM warehouse is tagged with a unique QR code. Each QR code bears information of the type and quantity of each item included in the kit. Warehouse staff scan the QR code upon release of the kit from the warehouse. Once kits arrive in partners’ warehouses and during distributions, partners scan the QR code using GPS-enabled mobile devices. Thus, each QR code is linked to a recipient beneficiary. The data for location, date and time of distribution, and beneficiary details are automatically uploaded to a secured and encrypted server."

There is a perceived gap between the rationale for undertaking AAP and its practical implications for programming that, if filled, can increase effectiveness.\nIOM advocates internally for AAP through a human rights-based approach, consistent with its global principles and values. Nevertheless, most informants interviewed noted that the AAP Framework places limited emphasis on how programme implementation can practically benefit from the feedback received from affected people. As one of them stated, “People have not realized the risk of not involving communities. It is crucial to show results [from involving affected people], not just principles. Explain to staff why they should do it.”\nSeveral respondents suggested including more AAP-related material in the next revision of the IOM Project Handbook, to bridge the gap between policy and practice more effectively. It was suggested that such integration should explicitly integrate AAP activities into the project cycle. Moreover, some suggested making the link between AAP and risk management stronger: affected people are often better positioned than IOM to make practical decisions about programme activities (for example, selecting playground locations, determining suitable livelihood options in the local context and addressing educational access challenges) and even when not, their input on these decisions is anyway essential to avoid gross operational mistakes. In this sense, it was suggested that the involvement of affected people can be framed also as a vital tool for mitigating risks inherent in humanitarian and development interventions."

The evaluators had a limited number of days to review the information, and the informants faced time and workload challenges in providing comprehensive responses and clarifications. As a result, not all of the evaluation questions could be addressed fully.\nAmong the six OECD evaluation criteria, “impact” received less focus due to the difficulty of measuring it across the various AAP policies, guidelines and initiatives. Furthermore, the theory of change was a challenging concept to elucidate because of insufficient input from relevant internal respondents, and it was therefore recommended for follow-up by the AAP Coordination Unit.\nThe evaluation team intended to interview key senior management members at IOM Headquarters, but the designated officers were unavailable. This limitation affected the inclusion of central-level senior officials’ perspectives in the findings and recommendations. Participation from senior management members in IOM country offices was, however, satisfactory.\nUltimately, another difficulty faced was the limited involvement of the AAP Coordination Unit in the evaluation process. This issue might stem from the fact that, at the time of this evaluation, an organizational restructuring process was ongoing. Moreover, this evaluation was commissioned by the CED, rather than the AAP Coordination Unit, potentially making it seem to the AAP Coordination Unit an unforeseen additional burden on already strained staff resources. Furthermore, some key IOM officers, who had been directly involved with developing the AAP Framework and coordinating related activities, had since moved to other roles, rendering them either unavailable or less available to discuss the findings and recommendations and to provide timely, detailed thematic feedback. Given factors such as the time constraints, the limited access to both senior management and AAP Coordination Unit"

Instead, it examined AAP activities worldwide based on aggregated data from national, regional and global levels.\nThe intended audience for this evaluation includes IOM management, IOM staff engaged in implementing the AAP approach at Headquarters and in the field, interested donors, Member States and both international and local partners.\nThe evaluation employed the six standard criteria of the OECD Development Assistance Committee: relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability (OECD, 2024). It also incorporated an analysis of the cross-cutting themes of gender, disability, environment and human rights-based approaches, as they intersected with AAP within IOM.

Accountability, respect, and fulfilment of the rights of migrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs), including protection, are also reflected in the Agenda on Internal Displacement and the Organization’s Strategic Vision.\nSaving lives, assisting, protecting, and working closely with all vulnerable groups and mobile populations affected by crisis are at the core of International Organization for Migration (IOM) operations. Responsive programming and project implementation in IOM require engaging affected populations in processes and decision-making early on, from needs assessments that aim to correctly identify their needs and contextual suitability including within communities, to program implementation and sustainablecompletion. The AAP Framework \\(2020^{3}\\) establishes IOM’s common approach and commitments for implementing and mainstreaming AAP and is mandatory throughout its crisis-related work as contained in its Migration Crisis Operational Framework 2012 and its Addendum of 2021. The framework was developed in line with the IASC commitments to AAP and adapted to meet IOM’s operational realities. The management of AAP in IOM is mainly the responsibility of the Department of Humanitarian Response and Recovery (DHRR), which works closely with other IOM entities for mainstreaming it, such as the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassment Unit (PSEAH).\nIOM collaborates with Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian affairs (OCHA), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC), World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and non- governmental actors in the domain of AAP and coordinates its work and contribution via IASC timebound Task Forces (TFs), responsible for delivering the Operational Policy and Advocacy Group (OPAG)-endorsednormative work for the 2022-2023.\n\nEVALUATION OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE … page 85\nSince AAP is high on the IASC and IOM’s agendas, IOM’s Central Evaluation Unit (EVA) considered strategically relevant to perform a comprehensive assessment of IOM’s work and performance in this areaand included it in its Biennial Evaluation Plan 2023-2024. The overall objective is to evaluate IOM’s strategic, institutional, and operational approach to AAP, and to provide recommendations and lessonslearned on how to further streamline, raise awareness on and advocate for AAP principles and commitments for the populations and communities IOM serves.\nMore specifically, the evaluation will examine IOM’s global engagement with AAP in crisis-related and noncrisis settings, including its policies, strategies, and programmatic approaches set-up since 2016 (which corresponds to the issuance of new IASC policies, WHS and New York Declaration), to take stock of internal and external synergies, adaptations and institutional steps adopted by IOM for an effective andsustained approach to AAP. It will identify good practices and areas of improvement regarding IOM’s decision-making, policymaking, technical guidance, and programme implementation for a comprehensiveand collaborative AAP approach, as well as for external coherence with UN agencies, organizations, and governments. The 2019 Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN) review of IOM noted improvements in AAP with the development of the framework, but highlighted that some key\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{3}\\) IOM’s Accountability to Affected Populations Framework outlines IOM’s principles and commitments to affected populations through leadership, information-sharing and transparency, participation, complaints and feedback mechanisms and partner coordination."

Many organizations are asking [the same] questions - it is discouraging”).\n\nImpact and Sustainability … page 58\nNo clear sign of broad impacts stemming from AAP activities could be identified, possibly due to the way that AAP in IOM Türkiye was siloed within specific programmes, and that its purpose was understood to be more about informing project-level adaptations than supporting a broader strategy entailing cultural or organizational change across the country office. Assessing the degree to which AAP activities are promoting the empowerment of affected persons is difficult. One survey respondent from IOM Türkiye stated, “There is experience of collecting feedback, but how to evaluate impact is something we have to work on.” Another stakeholder reported how too much surveying may be detrimental to empowerment, as too much energy is devoted to asking instead of emphasizing how communities can organize themselves and address their needs. The effort put into collecting data was also seen at times as disproportionate vis-à-vis the likelihood this would have triggered change.\nThe “projectized” funding structure of the Organization, together with a prevailing culture where “aid” delivery is central, but less consideration is given to learning and the long-term sustainability of the interventions undertaken, are seen as posing fundamental obstacles to AAP mainstreaming. One survey respondent from IOM Türkiye stated that “programmes usually are defensive or dismissive when reacting to beneficiary feedback. Lack of resources for AAP units makes it difficult to follow up on feedback and causes a lack of credibility of the whole function.” This points at the need for more structural investment in AAP, with the full and continued support of IOM Türkiye’s leadership.\nThe experience of community-led projects was seen by one of the interviewees in Gaziantep as highly relevant to AAP and worthy of careful evaluation or even impact assessment, primarily to better understand issues around participation and community empowerment. There is growing awareness in the humanitarian sector of the importance of empowering local communities to be more resilient to future shocks, and this is a further reason why AAP initiatives like community-led projects are so important. \\({ }^{32}\\) The development of a communityled project involves six steps: consultation (community consultation and FGD, to understand the dynamics of the communities); design (the communities’ and stakeholders’ contributions); implementation (to ensure that activities are participatory); monitoring (using quantitative and qualitative data); handover (to the community group or government); and evaluation (to assess the results and use them to enhance community impact). Examples of community-led projects mentioned by informants include building safety areas for children, developing communal spaces such as communal tents, and breast cancer awareness activities.\nIn its engagement with community-led projects, IOM is identifying community projects and conducting a neighbourhood profile. IOM is setting up community groups and trying to identify their needs (for example, a request for the refurbishment of a bread-making company), making links and referrals to other areas (such as health or education), and giving assistance in areas\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{32}\\) See the Flagship Initiative by OCHA."

    "text": "The notion of “accountability” in AAP should always be seen as collective, in the sense that the whole humanitarian and development system should be accountable to the affected people they are supposed to serve, rather than each single organization holding that accountability individually. All actors operating in a specific context should work in concert to achieve common goals and complement each other, based on their respective roles and capabilities, and that requires collective accountability. \\({ }^{25}\\) In this evaluation, collective accountability emerged as a frequent and important concept in the narration of many informants. Instances were described in which IOM established effective communication and coordination with other United Nations agencies and partners (for example, for the joint collection, analysis and dissemination of CFM or needs data) to promote collective accountability. In other cases, scenarios of limited inter-agency communication and collaboration on AAP were described, sometimes producing cumbersome or uncertain referrals, and sometimes making it impossible to properly address reasonable needs voiced by affected people, as these did not fall within the IOM operational sphere.\nMany examples of operational changes and adaptations that were based on feedback received from affected people were gathered as part of this evaluation, suggesting that AAP initiatives have some effectiveness in informing operations. At the same time, some findings point at the need to structure or strengthen the processes that translate feedback into meaningful operational adjustments (in a timely manner), and several informants perceived that not all data gathered from affected people were being used.\nAt an aggregate level, more and more AAP engagement is taking place in IOM, as confirmed by both the prevalent perceptions of informants and by the fact that indicators used to monitor AAP in IOM are generally recording substantial improvements. It is, however, doubtful whether the current level of AAP engagement is commensurate to the size of IOM operations. Moreover, IOM does not have a formal result matrix or a theory of change for AAP; rather, it relies on a collection of indicators from different institutional monitoring frameworks, mostly focusing on outputs and on broadly defined outcomes, which makes it hard to usefully assess the implementation of AAP. Overall progress still seems insufficient to support claims of AAP mainstreaming within the Organization.\nThe opinion that resources allocated to AAP in IOM are inadequate was prevalent in both qualitative and quantitative data gathered for this evaluation. The work that led to IN/285 was funded by donors on the basis of a specific initiative. The size of the central AAP unit in IOM Headquarters was generally deemed insufficient to proactively engage with technical support, capacity-building activities including training and programme and policy development. In country offices, AAP initiatives are most often funded by and within specific projects, with their scope tailored to the requirements of the funding initiative. Some informants doubted that IOM has a strategic approach to the funding of AAP, neither at the central nor at the country\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{25}\\) Some informants pointed out the fact that collective accountability applies not only to the organizations intervening in a certain operational context, but also to their donors. According to one informant, donors sometimes push for the integration of AAP into the initiatives they fund, but then are not necessarily equipped or willing to make adjustments to their funding allocations when these would be required to follow-up on feedback received from affected people. The role of donors was not sufficiently explored in this evaluation to formulate specific findings and recommendations on this issue. It is, however, hoped that this aspect will be explored in future evaluative work."

    "text": "Conduct a comprehensive assessment of all CFM systems currently in use within IOM.\nIdentify overlaps, gaps and areas for improvement in existing mechanisms.\nEstablish minimum standards and ensure compliance.\nDefine clear minimum standards for CFM systems to ensure consistency, efficiency and accessibility.\nImplement measures to ensure that all mapped CFMs align with these standards.\nDevelop and disseminate CFM-specific materials.\nCreate guidance documents, training materials and communication resources to support the effective implementation of CFMs.\nEnsure dissemination across all relevant teams and offices.\nMove towards standardization and integration.\nWork towards harmonizing CFM systems across IOM to ensure uniformity in processes and reporting.\nFacilitate the integration of CFMs into broader corporate systems for streamlined data collection and analysis. This recommendation relates to the many findings regarding CFMs in this evaluation, and in particular to how CFM development and management processes are being undertaken in autonomy by different offices or departments within IOM, resulting in duplication of effort and missed opportunities for efficiency and synergy. Central AAP functions are therefore recommended to control and regulate CFM-related processes and outputs more actively.\n\nNew guidance on developing and managing CFMs should cover both technological and organizational aspects, with the former focusing on minimum standards and compliance, and the latter promoting the development of office-wide CFM systems with clear processes, roles and responsibilities for the various functions available in the office.\nNoting also how CFM development has happened outside of institutional system development and management processes, after having established minimum standards, in particular on data protection, cybersecurity and data utilization (as the prevalent perception of informants was that not all CFM data are analysed and used), IOM should move towards the institutionalization of the more promising CFM systems available within IOM and beyond, possibly through a transparent, open selection process.\nRecommendation 9: IOM more broadly, and the AAP team more specifically, should continue the collaboration and engagement on collective accountability, actively participating in coordination structures on AAP, such as IASC-promoted initiatives or initiatives developed in other inter-agency coordination spaces, both at the global and country level.\nTo follow up this specific recommendation, the following activities should be implemented:\n\nDisseminate best practices on collective accountability and inter-agency coordination, including on the implementation of joint projects such as inter-agency CFMs or other similar initiatives, and conduct specific training courses on this matter."

According to the evaluation survey, 56 per cent of respondents confirmed their awareness of AAP had grown since 2021, while 80 per cent reports very high to moderate improvement in their knowledge and technical capacity regarding APP over the same period (Figure 5).\nInformants generally recognized that this progress was, at least in part, due to the training initiatives led by the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters. Informants involved in the facilitation or design of these trainings perceived them as “popular” among IOM staff based on how the response of trainees and their participation was perceived (however, neither exact figures on attendance, nor pre-training and post-training assessments were reviewed as part of this evaluation). At the same time, several informants, especially those operating in country offices, mentioned that capacity gaps persisted and lamented an often “superficial” understanding of AAP principles and concepts among the “average” IOM staffer, due to lack of practical knowledge on how to implement AAP in actual operational settings and in a nonimprovisational manner. Informants interviewed for both the IOM Türkiye and the IOM Ethiopia case studies provided similar remarks on a gap between understanding AAP and ability to implement it.\nFigure 5.

    "text": "Effectiveness … page 48\nInformants consulted for this case study largely perceived that affected communities are becoming increasingly aware of their rights and entitlements, leading to an increase in complaints and to the proactive provision of feedback. The effectiveness of the AAP Framework was evident, with instances of reports of aid diversion. In response, The IOM MEAL team investigate and implement corrective measures, including, as a last resort, the temporary suspension of aid distribution. The application of AAP to aid distribution entails the involvement of community representatives in the targeting and selection of beneficiaries, as well as the active engagement of community committees in the operationalization of CFMs.\nThe CFM reporting system utilized in camp settings was seen as effective for documenting complaints and queries from IDPs, assigning a unique number to each case for follow-up. Reports are centrally managed, analysed and shared with internal units and external partners for resolution. SMS text messaging was seen to be effective in informing beneficiaries about their entitlements. \\({ }^{28}\\)\nResort to hotline services has been growing, with utilization peaks reached during needs assessments, large-scale awareness campaigns, as well as during the onset of crises that create displacement. The hotline is a popular channel for voicing complaints, particularly for addressing sensitive issues like aid diversion, as it is easier for a caller to remain anonymous. The hotline data are also managed using a complaint-handling flow process that aligns with internal and IAAWG CFM guidance.\nSome challenges were mentioned concerning the effectiveness of hotline services. These include the fact that operators may not be familiar with all IOM interventions in the country (or those of other humanitarian actors), and that some reports inevitably go beyond the scope and reach of IOM operations. Additionally, phone network disruptions may make hotline services inaccessible, limiting the effectiveness of this channel in crisis situations where disruptions tend to be severe and protracted. Nevertheless, according to IOM Ethiopia’s complaints and feedback overview of January-June 2023, 73 per cent of complaints and feedback were addressed in a timely manner.\nRepeated complaints in IDP camps (for example, those in Tigray) on issues such as shelter maintenance, electricity and medical coverage for chronic illness (people with advanced age) to IOM and other partner organizations lead to beneficiary frustration. While some dissatisfaction stems from gaps between available support and community needs, other dissatisfaction arises from misconceptions about aid eligibility and unrealistic expectations. The comprehensive involvement of all partners, together with detailed information sharing regarding the project scope and capacity, were deemed as essential to address diverse needs comprehensively and efficiently.\nAn assessment of satisfaction with AAP mechanisms is integrated into post-distribution monitoring surveys. In the first half of 2024, 98 per cent of respondents ( \\(\\mathrm{N}=2271\\) ) reported\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{28}\\) The Socio-economic Reintegration of Ex-combatants (SERE) project piloted text messaging before the hotline was established in 2021.

IOM is following up with community groups, trying to monitor financial aspects and giving information sessions to inform about specific risks (for example, providing basic information on the proper use of fire extinguishers, communal light, and traffic safety). In the words of a staff member, “I believe community committees established, trained, and supported by IOM projects are good community systems that will ensure continued AAP beyond closure of IOM projects. Resources and capacity development need to be allocated for these committees to build their capacities and be able to continue their roles beyond projects.” Although community committees are distinct from community-led projects, they have overlapping benefits in that they are both examples of sustainable participation mechanisms which empower communities and help secure the future sustainability of the support provided by IOM.\n\nLessons Learned … page 59\n\nSenior management support was crucial to initiate AAP in IOM Türkiye. In particular, early senior management support was crucial to help set up the AAP mechanisms for cross-border operations.\nTraining courses on AAP were key for governmental buy-in on AAP. Training government partners in Ankara on AAP was key to secure support and buy-in for AAP initiatives and to create awareness of the importance of consulting communities, especially in terms of the potential for learning and adaptation.\n\n\n\nRecommendations … page 59\n\nDevelop an integrated AAP strategy for the IOM Türkiye Country Office as a whole, rather than a separate one for each programme. Place the responsibility for AAP within the programme supervision unit in collaboration with those responsible for monitoring and evaluation, and develop an office-wide strategy for IOM Türkiye, integrating the different tools for enhanced efficiency.\nIncrease coordination on AAP with other United Nations agencies and other relevant actors to foster collective accountability. Join efforts for collective accountability in Gaziantep and in Ankara or set up coordination for AAP when these are not available. Assess respondent fatigue and duplication in data collection to solve these issues as a priority.\nInvest more in community-led programmes. Change the approach from “what do you need?” to “what can we do together to improve?” Plan AAP initiatives with sustainability and empowerment in mind as opposed to only consultation on needs. Ask different questions that do not focus on needs but also on the possible contribution of affected people to change their lives and collaborate with IOM and other United Nations agencies.\nImprove in managing the expectations of affected people, while also making them more aware of the services available (such as the hotline). The AAP consultations were sometimes deemed to have led to increased expectations, which were then left unmet. Information and consultation protocols should be reviewed to better manage"

    "text": "informants suggested that, with regard to IOM distribution activities, consultations on distribution reach, quality and procedures with the affected people improved the integrity of the distribution process. These informants indicated that such AAP initiatives were taking place in IOM Türkiye.\nThe notion that AAP can lead to improvements in programme design and implementation, as well as to improved outcomes, was understood by most individuals consulted. Numerous examples were provided of past or ongoing initiatives to involve affected people in the project cycle, with a strong emphasis on the inclusion of women and people with disabilities. However, it was not always clear whether these initiatives necessarily translated into significant changes; nor was it clear that it fostered a sense of agency and empowerment among the individuals and communities involved. \\({ }^{21}\\)\nAt the field level, the evaluators came across initiatives supporting self-governance structures and participation in camp activities. Beneficiaries were encouraged to take on tasks related to on-site management and daily routines, and to running relatively small-scale projects. These initiatives were deemed as promising and relevant for enhancing the impact of AAP.\n\nSustainability … page 32\nEvaluation questions and themes for the “sustainability” criterion:\n\nEQ19. Does IOM’s participation in the United Nations and IASC mechanisms facilitate access to funding and resource mobilization related to AAP?\nEQ24. What systems are in place to address and guarantee the sustainability of IOM’s application of AAP principles and commitments in its interventions?\nEQ25. Does IOM’s engagement with governments, civil society, the United Nations, IASC and affected populations facilitate the sustainability of IOM’s support and accountability?\nEQ26. Has IOM’s integration of AAP principles in its work helped to generate stable and long-lasting participation and accountability mechanisms for people from affected marginalized groups?\n\nFinding 6.1: IN/285 constitutes a milestone achievement for sustainability, as it provides a legal basis for the IOM commitment to AAP. However, uneven leadership engagement and inadequate resourcing risk making this commitment aspirational rather than real.\nAs part of the Grand Bargain and other international commitments, IOM operates within a broader network of United Nations organizations and donors advocating for investment in AAP. Informants saw that active engagement in this environment was key to receiving dedicated funding for the development of the IOM AAP Framework. \\({ }^{22}\\) The release of IN/285\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{21}\\) Some results from the global survey also suggested less than clear outcomes in this area. When staff were asked if IOM activities had successfully enhanced the participation of vulnerable populations in decision-making processes and whether they had resulted in improved well-being and empowerment, results were mixed. See Annex E for the full details on the survey results. \\({ }^{22}\\) IOM has received substantial and dedicated donor support for the development of its AAP Framework, particularly from the United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. Informants also acknowledged the benefits gained from engagement with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) while developing the institutional AAP Framework."

Such guidance could include standard CFM SOPs, template feedback forms, off-the-shelf CFM management systems and CFM data analysis dashboards, all of which should be easily adapted to and deployed in field contexts. Training material and capacity-building resources should also be expanded accordingly and should place renewed focus on practical AAP implementation. The training supply should also be expanded, as demand is currently not fully met.\nFor the follow-up to this recommendation, the following activities should be considered:\n\nDevelop practical guidance material (such as a template and guidance for AAP datasharing agreements, CFM forms, etc.) based on the requests of field-level AAP focal persons and involving the AAP community of practice.\nCritically review current training methodology and identify ways in which training effectiveness can be enhanced, and in which the notions acquired can be put to practical use. This may include on-the-job training arrangements, training follow-ups, and peer review and engagement.\nInclude AAP-related material in the current revision of the IOM Project Handbook to bridge the gap between policy and practice.\nDevelop and conduct an AAP training-of-trainer initiative.\n\nRecommendation 8: The AAP team should enhance and standardize CFM systems used in IOM through the following actions:\n\nMap existing CFM systems."

As per the IOM website, the Organization operates in 171 countries globally and has 590 offices (IOM, n.d.b). From this viewpoint, results appear to be still a long way from achieving complete (or even extensive) coverage. Although the data from the indicators and the number of IOM offices indicated on the corporate website may not be directly comparable, doubts about whether the current progress should be considered satisfactory are legitimate.\nTable 3.

Programme changes cited included enhancing training sessions, offering more suitable shelters, revising procurement procedures to engage cost-effective services, integrating psychosocial support, installing additional lighting, designating a food distribution day for individuals with disabilities, identifying safer and more accessible locations for WASH facilities for women, improving ground insulation, transitioning from in-kind aid to cash-based interventions, promoting additional communal spaces, adjusting communication practices and cash delivery methods for households with special needs, addressing vulnerabilities, and enhancing the quality of food provided as well as refining beneficiary targeting and selection.\nIn the evaluation survey, respondents were asked to rate IOM competence in using feedback from affected people to modify programme implementation and enhance assistance: 43 per cent indicated a very high or high competence, 32 per cent gave a moderate rating, and 25 per cent rated it as low or very low. This varied perspective is supported by qualitative data: several of the IOM officers interviewed noted that considerable data are collected from affected people, but further efforts are needed to properly analyse and utilize it for informing implementation and future programme design. Others noted the lack of formal mechanisms"

Did IOM’s investments in AAP institutionalization and programmes lead to immediate and medium-term results and impacts that can be identified at global, regional, and national levels?\nEQ23. Did IOM’s programmes and projects have an impact on the representation and meaningful participation of particularly vulnerable population groups (i.e., women, girls, persons with disabilities) in decision making processes?\n\n\nFinding 5.1. While assessing impact is impossible at this stage, there are positive signs of increased involvement and engagement that might be attributable to AAP initiatives. … page 31\nDuring the course of this evaluation, several examples were gathered of AAP being effectively implemented in different operational contexts. IOM piloted the AAP Framework in Türkiye (see Case study 2), South Sudan and Nigeria. Noteworthy AAP practices have also been reported in Bangladesh (IOM, 2021c), Ethiopia (see Case study 1), Ukraine, the Response for Venezuela, Pakistan, Iraq and Somalia. In Ukraine, IOM developed several online consultation mechanisms to better reach mobile populations. In the Republic of Moldova, IOM has established a Telegram channel and has appointed a dedicated AAP officer to manage community engagements, trainings and hotlines, and to ensure the efficacy of the overall approach. \\({ }^{20}\\) In Ethiopia, a comprehensive AAP approach was developed, covering different functional and programmatic areas of the office. A common thread of the examples gathered was a strong leadership engagement, innovation and, in some cases, an expanded conception of AAP that included, for instance, actions to help increase the self-esteem of affected individuals (IOM, 2021c).\nExamples were also gathered of how engaging with affected people led to changes. In Ethiopia, it emerged that only men had access to short-term, unskilled or semi-skilled jobs (such as shelter maintenance, drainage system and water tanker installation) with partners in the camps: women within the committees advocated for equal job opportunities and this led to an increase in their participation in such roles. Also in Ethiopia, the design of shelters was modified based on women’s needs and preferences. Discussions highlighted the significance of common shelters, preferred by women as offering a better sense of safety. Concerns regarding sanitation were also resolved through open dialogues in various sessions.

According to the IOM situation report from Moldova for October-December 2023, “IOM continues to mainstream AAP through online information sessions, a toll-free call centre and community information centres, offering comprehensive information on IOM project activities, available support and acting as a platform for receiving complaints, feedback, and referrals. In November [2023], an information session hosted on IOM Moldova’s Telegram channel, with over 1,000 members, addressed 39 questions about IOM’s assistance. The toll-free call centre at 080010877 continues to serve as the primary channel for referrals, feedback, and complaints. Throughout the reporting period, a total of 1,433 calls were received, with most inquiries focusing on rental assistance, cash assistance, and legal support” (IOM, 2023e:6)."

The development of AAP guidance, SOPs and other key documents benefited greatly from participatory processes with field colleagues. For example, the SOPs for the integration of AAP and PSEAH in cash and in-kind interventions were discussed, amended and validated during a full day workshop with the AAP focal points from the different suboffices, to ensure they are operational and adapted to field offices’ capacities and contexts.

    "text": "Strengthen community-based reintegration efforts to address drivers of irregular migration and provide economic opportunities that reduce the necessity to migrate.\n\nThe current evaluation has demonstrated the great importance of CBR projects as a component of the integrated approach. However, gaps were found in the design, M&E, and relevance of some of the projects. Therefore, migrant protection, return and reintegration programming should be focused on enhancing the quality of the CBR projects in relation to the needs of the community members. Possibly, this may require larger-scale projects by a smaller sample of Implementing Partners, to ensure IOM can keep a better oversight of the project design, needs analysis and implementation.\nAdditionally, the CBR projects are an important occasion to ensure the involvement of local authorities. In line with Recommendation 1, IOM should continue focusing on enhancing ownership by local authorities through their increased engagement in CBR projects.\n\n3. Increase attention on building partnerships with service providers who can function without (significant) funding channelled by IOM. … page 29\nThe use of service providers not funded under the JI has multiple benefits to strengthen the work done under the JI. Namely, it can contribute to the capacity of service providers to support returnees; it contributes to the development and strengthening of referral systems; it contributes to policies on social security, insurance, and budgeting for service provisions; and finally, it reduces the costs of IOM. Therefore, capacity building of such existing service providers, who can function without significant financial support, can be a crucial element contributing to long-term impact and sustainability.\nTo continue strengthening partnerships, the IOM should also explore complementarity with other organisations which are focused on strengthening service provision. Namely, there is a need not only to strengthen partnerships and referrals but also to strengthen the quality of service provision in general (e.g. considering the lack of psychiatrists in Djibouti and lack of attention to mental health in most countries). Current efforts to build referral systems are not sustainable unless the service providers are able to function effectively themselves. 4. Explore opportunities for the continued (co-)funding of key, effective, and relevant activities in line with those supported under the JI-HOA. These activities include direct and specialized assistance in transit, including AVR assistance for migrants along all key migration routes from the HOA (including the Eastern, Southern, and Northern Route), an integrated approach to reintegration (individual reintegration support, CBR projects, structural level interventions) as well as support to the Regional Data Hub.\nThe work of IOM in countries of transit and destination has been noted as most relevant and important, as it directly involves the saving of lives. Therefore, the continuation of AVR support to migrants is directly linked to rescue and protection. A termination of this component, even if partial to specific migration routes, has detrimental consequences for migrants.\nThe evaluation found that the community-level approach to reintegration has been crucial for the achievements of the JI-HoA, both as standalone activities to enhance livelihoods, but also as integral component of the Integrated Approach. The effectiveness of the CBR projects to support reintegration and address drivers of irregular migration has been underlined and substantiated in this evaluation. Additionally, the evaluation found that the integrated approach itself is of great importance to link all"

Therefore, whether return processes have actually become safer, more humane and more dignified in general (without the support of IOM) is unclear.

The main goal of this framework was to provide advice and further strategies to support comprehensive migration management, to harmonise policies between countries, and to recommend and support formulating good policies in migration. The JI-HoA was aligned with the work of IGAD mainly in two pillars: gathering and disseminating quality data on migration and capacity building of the national governments \\({ }^{40}\\).\nAnother important framework is the Intergovernmental Authority on Development Regional Consultative Process on Migration (IGAD-RCP). In this joint work, the organizations involved worked on policy harmonization, policy development and capacity building \\({ }^{41}\\). Also, under the JI-HoA, IGAD started discussions about new initiatives on developing a child policy and regional AVRR framework \\({ }^{42}\\).\nThe JI-HoA was created on the basis of the commitments made by European and African leaders and is built on a partnership between the EU, the African Union (AU) and the UN \\({ }^{43}\\). The JI-HoA mostly corresponds to two main pillars of the Migration policy framework for Africa and Plan of Action (2018-2030) developed by the AUC, namely, 1) migration governance; and 2) irregular migration (including returns).\nOverall, coordination between IOM and other UN agencies and NGOs led to a lack of duplications and created opportunities for complementarity. Interviewees mostly agree that duplication is hardly possible due to the scope of support needed for the return migration and the fact that the JI-HoA programme has a unique integrated approach to the return and reintegration processes.\nAn IOM regional representative shared the procedure how they were structuring the process of avoiding potential duplication across different initiatives in each country:\nWe would map out the developmental activities carried out in a given country by NGO’s, other UN agencies, etc., and try to create the link between our returnees and activities of other actors so that they could be inserted within ongoing activities. We were not just replicating, but also trying to avoid duplicating what was already was already going on.\nSource: Interview with the IOM staff In short, the JI-HoA was able to build partnerships and complementarity with other development and aid organisations in the region, while avoiding duplication. This has also affected, to some extent, the cost-effectiveness of the JI-HoA, which is presented in the efficiency chapter.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{40}\\) IGAD. (2012).

This relates in particular to their ability to sustain themselves and their families economically.\nIn this regard, additional gains could be made by enrolling returnees back into formal education (for those who did not complete it), possibly with some allowance, and by focusing more attention to the development of entrepreneurial skills as foundation for starting sustainable (micro-)businesses. This requires additional research into the factors influencing the success of the businesses initiated by returnees under the JI. 6. Continue supporting and strengthening safe, humane, and orderly migration pathways, by providing direct support to migrants in distress, and engaging and building the capacities of key stakeholders involved in the process.\nThe most visible and important achievement of the JI-HoA has been the immediate, life-saving support provided to migrants who suffered various forms of abuse and trauma, and who did not have any other chance of returning. Currently, this evaluation believes that governments and stakeholders do not have the capacity to continue this work independently, although irregular migration continues to take place.\nHuman trafficking and abuse take place in all migration directions out of the Horn of Africa (North, East, and South) and therefore requires a continued investment in AVR in Djibouti and other transit countries from where migrants return to the HoA. Any gaps in provision of AVR has direct consequences for stranded migrants. 7. Build on the results of the IMPACT evaluation conducted under the JI-HoA by continuing to test and adjust the tools to measure reintegration sustainability and by conducting additional impact evaluations on key elements of AVRR.\nThe JI-HoA has commissioned the development of an IMPACT study which measured the sustainability of reintegration according to a predetermined methodology (RSS+). As the report mentions, the measurement of reintegration sustainability through preset indicators is rather new and"

External factors affecting the implementation of the JI … page 7\nOver the course of the Programme, multiple challenges outside the control of the IOM and its partners affected the implementation of the JI-HoA at the global and national levels.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic was first detected in each of the four programme countries in March 2020 and continued to spread after its initial discovery. The restrictions implemented led to some difficulties in the Programme’s implementation as workshops and activities became harder to conduct or had to be postponed. Direct assistance was also hindered by lockdowns.\nAlthough not explicitly named in interviews, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the \\(24^{\\text {th }}\\) of February 2022 is another factor that is likely to have impacted the final months as well as sustainability of the JI-HoA. The imposition of sanctions on Russia’s energy sector led to a sharp rise in the price of hydrocarbons. \\({ }^{7}\\)\nSeveral country-level events influenced the implementation and impact of the JI-HoA as well:\n\nIn Ethiopia, the conflict in Tigray which started in 2020 affected the return of migrants, distribution of reintegration assistance and conducting monitoring surveys in this region. \\({ }^{8}\\)\nIn Djibouti, risks to the Programme stemmed from the issues in other countries such as Ethiopia or Somalia spilling over into Djibouti. \\({ }^{9}\\)\nIn Somalia, the complicated security environment affected the smooth implementation of the Programme, e.g. continuous mortar attacks in airport compound. \\({ }^{10}\\)\nIn Sudan, the Programme was affected by rapidly rising inflation, political instability, a political coup and high turnover of government representatives. \\({ }^{14}\\)\n\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{7}\\) IEA.

Before the implementation of the JI-HoA programme, in most countries, there were limited frameworks or mechanism for migration, governments had no tools, and no national capacity building strategies which in turn led to limited capacity to facilitate return and reintegration. The JI-HoA programme addressed this gap through capacity building activities and tools such as the SOPs and various guidelines. \\({ }^{29}\\)\nInterviews revealed that the efforts of the JI-HoA regarding migration data were of particular relevance and importance to the stakeholders.

    "text": "Why This Matters\nUN agencies produce extensive evaluation reports and other public documents. For IOM, this body of knowledge is extensive and variegated, but putting it to practical use becomes more challenging as volume increases, particularly when documentation is stored across different repositories with no single index available.\nThe Challenge for IOM\nIOM’s evaluation production is highly decentralized, with reports stored across multiple repositories (the IOM Evaluation Repository, IOM Library, IOM Protection Platform). Quality varies greatly: quality control processes are not applied uniformly, and variation also reflects the inherent subjectivity in evaluation approaches and interpretations. Reports also vary significantly in structure: some follow common formats with executive summaries, findings, and recommendations, while others have different structures entirely. This inconsistency makes systematic mapping challenging.\nCritically, existing metadata doesn’t indicate which elements of IOM’s strategic frameworks (the Strategic Results Framework (SRF) or the Global Compact for Migration (GCM)) each report addresses. This is a major gap that limits the ability to connect evaluation evidence with key strategic frameworks.\nEvidence Maps as a Solution\nEvidence Maps display the extent and nature of research and evaluation available on a subject. Following the 2025 UNEG Eval Week, four primary use cases emerged: guiding future evidence generation, informing policy decisions, knowledge management, and enhancing collaboration. The maps created by iomeval serve primarily as knowledge management tools—structured repositories that make identifying relevant sources easier by organizing them against strategic framework components.\nWhat This Enables\nBy tagging reports against SRF outputs, enablers, cross-cutting priorities, and GCM objectives, these maps help answer questions like: Which framework elements are well-covered by existing evaluations? Where are the knowledge gaps that should prioritize future evaluation work? Which themes have enough evidence for a dedicated synthesis report?",

You have two options:\nOption 1: Environment variables (recommended for production)\nexport ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key-here'\nexport MISTRAL_API_KEY='your-key-here'\nOption 2: .env file (convenient for development)\nCreate a .env file in your project root:\nANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here\nMISTRAL_API_KEY=your-key-here\nSince lisette supports all major LLM providers via litellm, you can configure other providers (OpenAI, Google, etc.) by setting their respective API keys using either method.",

    "text": "Examples of programme adaptation triggered by feedback received via the CFMs were provided both in the context of refugee response and cross-border operations. For instance, the schedule of vocational training sessions was changed to allow easier participation by those working regular hours; the expansion or introduction of cash-based interventions in both contexts followed preferences shared by beneficiaries; the introduction of Turkish language courses followed requests from female beneficiaries; and school transportation services were adapted to better serve needs.\nExamples of insufficient or slow adaptation were also gathered. According to some stakeholders consulted, the assistance received from the cross-border programme was not always aligned with the needs of people: for example, food kits were perceived as not relevant but humanitarian programming took a long time to adjust to feedback. The assistance was perceived as following a “pre-planned” model that could not be changed easily (or at all), even if feedback was provided. Local communities were known to complain that livelihood projects were limited, demanding more structural interventions to promote economic development (something not necessarily within the scope of the ongoing interventions). Finally, the limited participation of local councils or community leaders in needs assessments was mentioned, stressing how this can affect the overall efficacy of AAP.\n\nEfficiency … page 57\nData gathered for this case study suggest that there were limited linkages between programme units and monitoring and evaluation functions. Moreover, according to an informant, monitoring and evaluation activities were sometimes left “out of the loop”. The same informant perceived that many colleagues still viewed monitoring and evaluation as an audit process rather than something that facilitates learning and project adaptation. Processes for running AAP mechanisms were generally not perceived as streamlined and a demand for more in-depth and practical AAP training was voiced, as webinars and other “virtual” forms of dissemination were not perceived as sufficient.\nSeveral informants noted that acting on some of the complaints received was more difficult than what it should have been. Answering such complaints sometimes took longer than expected and doubts persisted on what constitutes an efficient channel or solution to manage feedback efficiently. Internal coordination between different teams within IOM was seen as limited, and it was not always clear how to secure resources for concrete follow-up actions, such as sharing vehicles for reaching far away locations for beneficiary visits. Another set of difficulties identified focused on how the ability of beneficiaries to express their concerns and liaise with IOM in order to find solutions was constrained by the beneficiaries’ lack of contextual information, lack of literacy and vulnerability.\nThe limited collaboration between IOM and other United Nations partner agencies mentioned above may have had repercussions on efficiency, as well as on coherence. One informant stated that sometimes the issues raised by beneficiaries went beyond the reach of IOM, and pointed to the difficulty of coordinated responses. The same informant also explained how the lack of coordination is fatiguing for affected people, especially when similar questions are asked by different organizations, and when responses do not follow the questions (“In some"

    "text": "Finding 3.4. The institutional framework for monitoring the implementation of AAP policy is basic and predominantly focuses on outputs rather than outcomes and impacts. The IOM SRF (2024) is commendable in that it shifts its focus towards outcomes, including service and programme satisfaction revised according to feedback from affected people, but there is still a need for a specific and comprehensive monitoring framework for AAP.\nThe monitoring of AAP in IOM is based on indicators included in other institutional monitoring tools rather than having its own dedicated logical framework based on a clear theory of change. The indicators used show that the focus of monitoring activities is predominantly on outputs, with targets not clearly defined and with an unclear distinction between outputs, outcomes and impacts, or objectives.\nIn the IOM Strategic Plan 2024-2028 and the IOM SRF, new AAP indicators have been included (see Annex C) that can enhance reflection on the tangible benefits of AAP. Concerning the identification of good practices, some informants in field offices expressed uncertainty on how “success stories” were identified by IOM Headquarters.\nFinding 3.5. Engagement with and awareness of AAP among senior or leadership officers is unequal, with officers in field offices being more committed to AAP than those in central functions.\nSeveral IOM officers consulted believed that senior leadership was somewhat disengaged from AAP or only marginally attentive to it. This sentiment is also reflected by the resources allocated to AAP activities at the central level, which several informants considered to be inadequate. \\({ }^{14}\\) The limited investment of core funding in AAP - with, at the time of this evaluation, the AAP Coordination Unit primarily being staffed by consultants funded by a specific USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance initiative - is perceived as a sign that implementing AAP is not a top priority for IOM.\nSenior staff consulted in field offices generally appeared to be engaged with and aware of AAP. In the IOM Ethiopia Country Office, for instance, AAP was addressed at the highest organizational level, enabling the appointment of AAP focal points for all suboffices, setting up mechanisms to share data with external partners, and holding discussions with the United Nations Country Team (see Case study 1). Conversely, the engagement of leadership at the headquarters level seemed to be confined to the initial stages, during the design and launch of the AAP Framework. This evaluation attempted to consult senior IOM Headquarters officers on this matter, but interviews did not take place due to the unavailability of the individuals contacted. \\({ }^{15}\\)\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{14}\\) This finding, gathered in 2024, backs up the 2023 MOPAN analysis regarding AAP, which concluded that IOM had not yet been able to consistently incorporate AAP across all its programmes and did not invest adequately in AAP, considering the scale of its operations. \\({ }^{15}\\) The unavailability of senior IOM Headquarters staff to be interviewed for this evaluation was interpreted as a sign of limited engagement on the matter."

The perspectives of Member States were not sufficiently explored for this evaluation to determine if alignment exists or not. However, IOM informants reported that a total of 225 affected persons, from different countries, participated in the consultation phase of the AAP Framework, prior to its piloting in 2018.\nIOM staff noted during interviews and in the survey that local communities may not always recognize the advantages of feedback mechanisms, or that there may be some cultural barriers to providing feedback. For example, one informant described how, in some contexts in Myanmar, giving negative feedback on assistance received may be avoided so as not to “show lack of gratitude”. Staff attempt to convey that the assistance provided is an entitlement; however, obtaining open and candid feedback may be difficult in such contexts, meaning that any application (and assessment) of AAP needs an awareness of culturally appropriate approaches.\nFinding 1.2. AAP is deemed as having general relevance for IOM, although IN/285 is specific to emergency response contexts. \\({ }^{9}\\) The AAP team has effectively promoted the framework, but there is an unmet demand for translating theoretical guidelines into more practical tools and solutions. Exchange of practical experiences between various field offices.\nThe AAP Framework has a degree of specificity to humanitarian and emergency response operations. This was found to generate confusion about the operational scope of AAP, although AAP principles and approaches were felt to be relevant also for non-emergency contexts. Some informants suggested that the focus of the current AAP Framework could be revised to strengthen connections with the Sustainable Development Goals.\nA distinction should be drawn between the AAP Framework (IN/285) and other guidance and tools available for its “operationalization” (such as the IOM AAP toolkits on participation, (2020a), on information sharing and transparency (2020b), and on CFM (2020d)). Perceptions of the Framework often differed from perceptions of the guidance and tools. Most staff interviewed during KIIs found that the Framework was helpful for defining the role of AAP and its importance for the Organization. In contrast, only half of the respondents to the global survey (Figure 3) rated the usefulness of AAP guidance and tools as very high (17%) or high (29%). Informants often felt that, while IN/285 effectively frames AAP, the tools provided and guidance available for the actual implementation of AAP approaches were not as practical as they should be.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{9}\\) It should be noted that, since 2024, AAP has gained formal relevance across all IOM programming as its oversight was shifted from the Department of Emergencies to the Protection Division. These developments took place during the evaluation period and could not be fully reflected in the findings, but they are relevant to their interpretation."

These perceptions find confirmation from the desk review conducted for this evaluation, which identified only a relatively limited amount of public documentation and externally facing dissemination material on AAP initiatives led by IOM.\n\nCoherence … page 21\nEvaluation questions and themes for the “coherence” criterion:\n\nEQ7. Which mechanisms are in place to guarantee internal coherence for the inclusion of AAP principles and commitment in relevant IOM areas of work?\nEQ8. Does IOM effectively align its AAP interventions with United Nations and IASC AAP related guidance and mechanisms at global, regional, and national levels?\nEQ9. Are IOM AAP principles, mechanism and framework encouraging and reinforcing international and local partnerships for a comprehensive response tailored to the needs of affected populations?\nEQ11. Have IOM AAP Framework initiatives been effective to foster coordination with local and international partners for a better response, tailored to the identified needs of the affected populations?\n\nFinding 2.1. IOM pursues AAP through various frameworks and initiatives that are not always coordinated.\nAt a general level, IOM is widely receptive to the integration of AAP principles and initiatives into its interventions. AAP-related initiatives were being pursued even before AAP was formalized in IN/285, though according to one informant, AAP was probably seen as “good programming” rather than a mandatory requirement.\nAccording to most informants, the idea of actively listening to and engaging with affected people is on the way to becoming fully accepted by IOM staff. This sentiment is exemplified by one chief of mission who stated that “regular consultations are embedded in everything we do.” This finding is supported by interviews with IOM regional and country offices, where the staff consulted reported frequent engagement with affected people before interventions, during programme implementation, in post-assessment surveys, and in community programmes to run local initiatives.\nAccording to many informants - and as also confirmed by the Turkish and Ethiopian case studies - collaboration on the implementation of AAP initiatives, as well as the search for synergies between different projects, units, or departments implementing AAP, appears to be challenging in IOM. Informants interviewed from various regions, particularly those in field offices, highlighted communication challenges within IOM departments and across different thematic initiatives. Despite increasing efforts to enhance connections between AAP and PSEAH, to enhance connections between AAP and the rights-based approach, and to enhance the gathering of AAP data by the DTM unit, difficulties persist.

There were different CFMs in place and their management was primarily considered to be the responsibility of those running monitoring and evaluation processes. Other types of AAP initiatives (for example, information sharing, participation in decision-making and project adaptation) were also being undertaken, with programme teams considered directly responsible for them.\nConsultations conducted for this case study suggest that the available global guidance on AAP had limited influence in shaping the local AAP strategy and work. A need and demand for more specific guidance and tools (SOPs, “off-the-shelf” systems) was voiced: one IOM staff member interviewed said “more guidance on how to operationalize certain activities would be helpful”. Informants confirmed that IOM Türkiye received some support from IOM Headquarters in establishing AAP initiatives. At the same time, IOM Headquarters was seen by an informant as “requesting rather than providing support”, considering the balance between the amount of support available for the implementation of new policies and the requests and expectations from different departments in IOM Headquarters. In the context of the refugee response, the SOP for the cross-border operations CFM was reviewed by IOM Headquarters and the feedback received was deemed to be useful.\nIn terms of whether AAP in IOM Türkiye considered cross-cutting issues, the evaluator observed that special consideration was given to women. Concerning the inclusion of people with disabilities, some interviewees mentioned that visits were being conducted to hear their concerns and suggestions. A senior IOM staff member mentioned that disability was an area of work and concern receiving growing attention in the mission. Focal points for disability were said to have been nominated for some programmes. Conversely, no evidence that consideration was being given to environmental sustainability could be found. \\({ }^{31}\\)\nIn general, most informants did not feel that AAP was a priority for IOM Türkiye, especially as a restructuring of the office entailing a reduction of personnel was ongoing at the time of the consultations.

These entailed 12 KIIs, as well as five FGDs attended by a total of 57 individuals ( 26 women and 31 men). Consultations were conducted in the IOM Ankara Country Office and in the Gaziantep Suboffice.\nTürkiye was selected for a case study following the suggestion of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters, with the intention of focusing on AAP in the context of IOM Türkiye’s crossborder operations with Syria. The evaluator decided to also include in the scope of the consultations AAP-related initiatives undertaken for IOM Türkiye’s refugee response operations, in order to gain a more comprehensive view of AAP in the country office and to see how AAP activities undertaken by the two different programmes interrelated. Additional interviews were also held with programme officers in Ankara not working on either of the two initiatives, to gauge the extent of AAP implementation in other operational domains.\n\n\nTürkiye Context … page 53\nIn IOM Türkiye, at the time of this evaluation, there was a structured CFM specifically set up for the cross-border operations between Türkiye and Syria. This system was managed from the Gaziantep Suboffice by the cross-border programme. Another CFM was set up for the refugee response programme and was led by the monitoring and evaluation unit, also in Gaziantep. The monitoring and evaluation unit and the cross-border programme unit were observed to work quite independently of each other.\nThe monitoring and evaluation system for cross-border operations was designed in a context where implementation relied to a large extent on the implementing partners, and IOM needed an effective system to monitor progress and assess whether or not the programme activities were being executed properly. As illustrated in Figure 8, the monitoring and evaluation system was articulated in three components: a commodity tracking system; third-party monitoring; and AAP. The commodity tracking system applied a unique barcode-based identification number to every single kit delivered to beneficiaries, \\({ }^{30}\\) allowing the beneficiary to confirm whether they received the assistance or not. Third-party monitoring was implemented by Kudra Social Development Solutions, a partner with presence in both Syria and Türkiye (Gaziantep) contracted by IOM to manage beneficiary verification, distribution monitoring and exit interviews, post-distribution monitoring, and satisfaction surveys. A CFM designated as the “Dialogue, Information and Participation System” (DIPS) was established in late 2018. It consisted of a hotline together with mechanisms to share information and collect complaints and feedback via WhatsApp. Figure 8 also refers to “endorsement”: an important responsibility\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{30}\\) According to IOM Türkiye officers, the commodity tracking system tracks the movement of humanitarian supplies from the IOM warehouse in Gaziantep to the intended locations in Syria. The system allows IOM to know that a shipment reached its intended delivery location, and the specific time it did, which strengthens accountability and transparency in all distributions. Every kit released from the IOM warehouse is tagged with a unique QR code. Each QR code bears information of the type and quantity of each item included in the kit. Warehouse staff scan the QR code upon release of the kit from the warehouse. Once kits arrive in partners’ warehouses and during distributions, partners scan the QR code using GPS-enabled mobile devices. Thus, each QR code is linked to a recipient beneficiary. The data for location, date and time of distribution, and beneficiary details are automatically uploaded to a secured and encrypted server."

Mehiret Habte led the consultations. This case study is intended to provide valuable information and insight into the global evaluation of AAP within IOM, by focusing on an IOM country office that has built a significant AAP portfolio, encompassing both emergency and non-emergency interventions. Acknowledgment is given to the engagement and support of the MEAL team of IOM Ethiopia, as well as the AAP focal points in the suboffices of the same IOM country office.\n\n\n\nIn IOM Ethiopia, the overall coordination of AAP rests with the MEAL unit. Three full-time personnel (one programme assistant and two hotline operators), directly supported by one National MEAL officer and the MEAL coordinator, dedicate about 25 per cent of their time to AAP. The other two MEAL officers in the unit are also actively engaged in AAP.

There is a perceived gap between the rationale for undertaking AAP and its practical implications for programming that, if filled, can increase effectiveness.\nIOM advocates internally for AAP through a human rights-based approach, consistent with its global principles and values. Nevertheless, most informants interviewed noted that the AAP Framework places limited emphasis on how programme implementation can practically benefit from the feedback received from affected people. As one of them stated, “People have not realized the risk of not involving communities. It is crucial to show results [from involving affected people], not just principles. Explain to staff why they should do it.”\nSeveral respondents suggested including more AAP-related material in the next revision of the IOM Project Handbook, to bridge the gap between policy and practice more effectively. It was suggested that such integration should explicitly integrate AAP activities into the project cycle. Moreover, some suggested making the link between AAP and risk management stronger: affected people are often better positioned than IOM to make practical decisions about programme activities (for example, selecting playground locations, determining suitable livelihood options in the local context and addressing educational access challenges) and even when not, their input on these decisions is anyway essential to avoid gross operational mistakes. In this sense, it was suggested that the involvement of affected people can be framed also as a vital tool for mitigating risks inherent in humanitarian and development interventions."

As a result, not all of the evaluation questions could be addressed fully.\nAmong the six OECD evaluation criteria, “impact” received less focus due to the difficulty of measuring it across the various AAP policies, guidelines and initiatives. Furthermore, the theory of change was a challenging concept to elucidate because of insufficient input from relevant internal respondents, and it was therefore recommended for follow-up by the AAP Coordination Unit.\nThe evaluation team intended to interview key senior management members at IOM Headquarters, but the designated officers were unavailable. This limitation affected the inclusion of central-level senior officials’ perspectives in the findings and recommendations. Participation from senior management members in IOM country offices was, however, satisfactory.\nUltimately, another difficulty faced was the limited involvement of the AAP Coordination Unit in the evaluation process. This issue might stem from the fact that, at the time of this evaluation, an organizational restructuring process was ongoing. Moreover, this evaluation was commissioned by the CED, rather than the AAP Coordination Unit, potentially making it seem to the AAP Coordination Unit an unforeseen additional burden on already strained staff resources. Furthermore, some key IOM officers, who had been directly involved with developing the AAP Framework and coordinating related activities, had since moved to other roles, rendering them either unavailable or less available to discuss the findings and recommendations and to provide timely, detailed thematic feedback.

Many organizations are asking [the same] questions - it is discouraging”).\nImpact and Sustainability No clear sign of broad impacts stemming from AAP activities could be identified, possibly due to the way that AAP in IOM Türkiye was siloed within specific programmes, and that its purpose was understood to be more about informing project-level adaptations than supporting a broader strategy entailing cultural or organizational change across the country office. Assessing the degree to which AAP activities are promoting the empowerment of affected persons is difficult. One survey respondent from IOM Türkiye stated, “There is experience of collecting feedback, but how to evaluate impact is something we have to work on.” Another stakeholder reported how too much surveying may be detrimental to empowerment, as too much energy is devoted to asking instead of emphasizing how communities can organize themselves and address their needs. The effort put into collecting data was also seen at times as disproportionate vis-à-vis the likelihood this would have triggered change.\nThe “projectized” funding structure of the Organization, together with a prevailing culture where “aid” delivery is central, but less consideration is given to learning and the long-term sustainability of the interventions undertaken, are seen as posing fundamental obstacles to AAP mainstreaming. One survey respondent from IOM Türkiye stated that “programmes usually are defensive or dismissive when reacting to beneficiary feedback. Lack of resources for AAP units makes it difficult to follow up on feedback and causes a lack of credibility of the whole function.” This points at the need for more structural investment in AAP, with the full and continued support of IOM Türkiye’s leadership.\nThe experience of community-led projects was seen by one of the interviewees in Gaziantep as highly relevant to AAP and worthy of careful evaluation or even impact assessment, primarily to better understand issues around participation and community empowerment. There is growing awareness in the humanitarian sector of the importance of empowering local communities to be more resilient to future shocks, and this is a further reason why AAP initiatives like community-led projects are so important. \\({ }^{32}\\) The development of a communityled project involves six steps: consultation (community consultation and FGD, to understand the dynamics of the communities); design (the communities’ and stakeholders’ contributions); implementation (to ensure that activities are participatory); monitoring (using quantitative and qualitative data); handover (to the community group or government); and evaluation (to assess the results and use them to enhance community impact). Examples of community-led projects mentioned by informants include building safety areas for children, developing communal spaces such as communal tents, and breast cancer awareness activities.\nIn its engagement with community-led projects, IOM is identifying community projects and conducting a neighbourhood profile. IOM is setting up community groups and trying to identify their needs (for example, a request for the refurbishment of a bread-making company), making links and referrals to other areas (such as health or education), and giving assistance in areas\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{32}\\) See the Flagship Initiative by OCHA."

    "text": "The notion of “accountability” in AAP should always be seen as collective, in the sense that the whole humanitarian and development system should be accountable to the affected people they are supposed to serve, rather than each single organization holding that accountability individually. All actors operating in a specific context should work in concert to achieve common goals and complement each other, based on their respective roles and capabilities, and that requires collective accountability. \\({ }^{25}\\) In this evaluation, collective accountability emerged as a frequent and important concept in the narration of many informants. Instances were described in which IOM established effective communication and coordination with other United Nations agencies and partners (for example, for the joint collection, analysis and dissemination of CFM or needs data) to promote collective accountability. In other cases, scenarios of limited inter-agency communication and collaboration on AAP were described, sometimes producing cumbersome or uncertain referrals, and sometimes making it impossible to properly address reasonable needs voiced by affected people, as these did not fall within the IOM operational sphere.\nMany examples of operational changes and adaptations that were based on feedback received from affected people were gathered as part of this evaluation, suggesting that AAP initiatives have some effectiveness in informing operations. At the same time, some findings point at the need to structure or strengthen the processes that translate feedback into meaningful operational adjustments (in a timely manner), and several informants perceived that not all data gathered from affected people were being used.\nAt an aggregate level, more and more AAP engagement is taking place in IOM, as confirmed by both the prevalent perceptions of informants and by the fact that indicators used to monitor AAP in IOM are generally recording substantial improvements. It is, however, doubtful whether the current level of AAP engagement is commensurate to the size of IOM operations. Moreover, IOM does not have a formal result matrix or a theory of change for AAP; rather, it relies on a collection of indicators from different institutional monitoring frameworks, mostly focusing on outputs and on broadly defined outcomes, which makes it hard to usefully assess the implementation of AAP. Overall progress still seems insufficient to support claims of AAP mainstreaming within the Organization.\nThe opinion that resources allocated to AAP in IOM are inadequate was prevalent in both qualitative and quantitative data gathered for this evaluation. The work that led to IN/285 was funded by donors on the basis of a specific initiative. The size of the central AAP unit in IOM Headquarters was generally deemed insufficient to proactively engage with technical support, capacity-building activities including training and programme and policy development. In country offices, AAP initiatives are most often funded by and within specific projects, with their scope tailored to the requirements of the funding initiative. Some informants doubted that IOM has a strategic approach to the funding of AAP, neither at the central nor at the country\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{25}\\) Some informants pointed out the fact that collective accountability applies not only to the organizations intervening in a certain operational context, but also to their donors. According to one informant, donors sometimes push for the integration of AAP into the initiatives they fund, but then are not necessarily equipped or willing to make adjustments to their funding allocations when these would be required to follow-up on feedback received from affected people. The role of donors was not sufficiently explored in this evaluation to formulate specific findings and recommendations on this issue. It is, however, hoped that this aspect will be explored in future evaluative work."

This recommendation relates to the many findings regarding CFMs in this evaluation, and in particular to how CFM development and management processes are being undertaken in autonomy by different offices or departments within IOM, resulting in duplication of effort and missed opportunities for efficiency and synergy. Central AAP functions are therefore recommended to control and regulate CFM-related processes and outputs more actively.\n\nNew guidance on developing and managing CFMs should cover both technological and organizational aspects, with the former focusing on minimum standards and compliance, and the latter promoting the development of office-wide CFM systems with clear processes, roles and responsibilities for the various functions available in the office.\nNoting also how CFM development has happened outside of institutional system development and management processes, after having established minimum standards, in particular on data protection, cybersecurity and data utilization (as the prevalent perception of informants was that not all CFM data are analysed and used), IOM should move towards the institutionalization of the more promising CFM systems available within IOM and beyond, possibly through a transparent, open selection process.\nRecommendation 9: IOM more broadly, and the AAP team more specifically, should continue the collaboration and engagement on collective accountability, actively participating in coordination structures on AAP, such as IASC-promoted initiatives or initiatives developed in other inter-agency coordination spaces, both at the global and country level.\nTo follow up this specific recommendation, the following activities should be implemented:\n\nDisseminate best practices on collective accountability and inter-agency coordination, including on the implementation of joint projects such as inter-agency CFMs or other similar initiatives, and conduct specific training courses on this matter."

    "text": "Effectiveness … page 48\nInformants consulted for this case study largely perceived that affected communities are becoming increasingly aware of their rights and entitlements, leading to an increase in complaints and to the proactive provision of feedback. The effectiveness of the AAP Framework was evident, with instances of reports of aid diversion. In response, The IOM MEAL team investigate and implement corrective measures, including, as a last resort, the temporary suspension of aid distribution. The application of AAP to aid distribution entails the involvement of community representatives in the targeting and selection of beneficiaries, as well as the active engagement of community committees in the operationalization of CFMs.\nThe CFM reporting system utilized in camp settings was seen as effective for documenting complaints and queries from IDPs, assigning a unique number to each case for follow-up. Reports are centrally managed, analysed and shared with internal units and external partners for resolution. SMS text messaging was seen to be effective in informing beneficiaries about their entitlements. \\({ }^{28}\\)\nResort to hotline services has been growing, with utilization peaks reached during needs assessments, large-scale awareness campaigns, as well as during the onset of crises that create displacement. The hotline is a popular channel for voicing complaints, particularly for addressing sensitive issues like aid diversion, as it is easier for a caller to remain anonymous. The hotline data are also managed using a complaint-handling flow process that aligns with internal and IAAWG CFM guidance.\nSome challenges were mentioned concerning the effectiveness of hotline services. These include the fact that operators may not be familiar with all IOM interventions in the country (or those of other humanitarian actors), and that some reports inevitably go beyond the scope and reach of IOM operations. Additionally, phone network disruptions may make hotline services inaccessible, limiting the effectiveness of this channel in crisis situations where disruptions tend to be severe and protracted. Nevertheless, according to IOM Ethiopia’s complaints and feedback overview of January-June 2023, 73 per cent of complaints and feedback were addressed in a timely manner.\nRepeated complaints in IDP camps (for example, those in Tigray) on issues such as shelter maintenance, electricity and medical coverage for chronic illness (people with advanced age) to IOM and other partner organizations lead to beneficiary frustration. While some dissatisfaction stems from gaps between available support and community needs, other dissatisfaction arises from misconceptions about aid eligibility and unrealistic expectations. The comprehensive involvement of all partners, together with detailed information sharing regarding the project scope and capacity, were deemed as essential to address diverse needs comprehensively and efficiently.\nAn assessment of satisfaction with AAP mechanisms is integrated into post-distribution monitoring surveys.

In the words of a staff member, “I believe community committees established, trained, and supported by IOM projects are good community systems that will ensure continued AAP beyond closure of IOM projects. Resources and capacity development need to be allocated for these committees to build their capacities and be able to continue their roles beyond projects.” Although community committees are distinct from community-led projects, they have overlapping benefits in that they are both examples of sustainable participation mechanisms which empower communities and help secure the future sustainability of the support provided by IOM.\n\nLessons Learned … page 59\n\nSenior management support was crucial to initiate AAP in IOM Türkiye. In particular, early senior management support was crucial to help set up the AAP mechanisms for cross-border operations.\nTraining courses on AAP were key for governmental buy-in on AAP. Training government partners in Ankara on AAP was key to secure support and buy-in for AAP initiatives and to create awareness of the importance of consulting communities, especially in terms of the potential for learning and adaptation.\n\n\n\nRecommendations … page 59\n\nDevelop an integrated AAP strategy for the IOM Türkiye Country Office as a whole, rather than a separate one for each programme. Place the responsibility for AAP within the programme supervision unit in collaboration with those responsible for monitoring and evaluation, and develop an office-wide strategy for IOM Türkiye, integrating the different tools for enhanced efficiency.\nIncrease coordination on AAP with other United Nations agencies and other relevant actors to foster collective accountability. Join efforts for collective accountability in Gaziantep and in Ankara or set up coordination for AAP when these are not available. Assess respondent fatigue and duplication in data collection to solve these issues as a priority.\nInvest more in community-led programmes. Change the approach from “what do you need?” to “what can we do together to improve?” Plan AAP initiatives with sustainability and empowerment in mind as opposed to only consultation on needs. Ask different questions that do not focus on needs but also on the possible contribution of affected people to change their lives and collaborate with IOM and other United Nations agencies.\nImprove in managing the expectations of affected people, while also making them more aware of the services available (such as the hotline). The AAP consultations were sometimes deemed to have led to increased expectations, which were then left unmet. Information and consultation protocols should be reviewed to better manage"

These informants indicated that such AAP initiatives were taking place in IOM Türkiye.\nThe notion that AAP can lead to improvements in programme design and implementation, as well as to improved outcomes, was understood by most individuals consulted. Numerous examples were provided of past or ongoing initiatives to involve affected people in the project cycle, with a strong emphasis on the inclusion of women and people with disabilities. However, it was not always clear whether these initiatives necessarily translated into significant changes; nor was it clear that it fostered a sense of agency and empowerment among the individuals and communities involved. \\({ }^{21}\\)\nAt the field level, the evaluators came across initiatives supporting self-governance structures and participation in camp activities. Beneficiaries were encouraged to take on tasks related to on-site management and daily routines, and to running relatively small-scale projects. These initiatives were deemed as promising and relevant for enhancing the impact of AAP.\n\nSustainability … page 32\nEvaluation questions and themes for the “sustainability” criterion:\n\nEQ19.

Has IOM’s integration of AAP principles in its work helped to generate stable and long-lasting participation and accountability mechanisms for people from affected marginalized groups?\n\nFinding 6.1: IN/285 constitutes a milestone achievement for sustainability, as it provides a legal basis for the IOM commitment to AAP. However, uneven leadership engagement and inadequate resourcing risk making this commitment aspirational rather than real.\nAs part of the Grand Bargain and other international commitments, IOM operates within a broader network of United Nations organizations and donors advocating for investment in AAP. Informants saw that active engagement in this environment was key to receiving dedicated funding for the development of the IOM AAP Framework. \\({ }^{22}\\) The release of IN/285\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{21}\\) Some results from the global survey also suggested less than clear outcomes in this area.

Such guidance could include standard CFM SOPs, template feedback forms, off-the-shelf CFM management systems and CFM data analysis dashboards, all of which should be easily adapted to and deployed in field contexts. Training material and capacity-building resources should also be expanded accordingly and should place renewed focus on practical AAP implementation. The training supply should also be expanded, as demand is currently not fully met.\nFor the follow-up to this recommendation, the following activities should be considered:\n\nDevelop practical guidance material (such as a template and guidance for AAP datasharing agreements, CFM forms, etc.) based on the requests of field-level AAP focal persons and involving the AAP community of practice.\nCritically review current training methodology and identify ways in which training effectiveness can be enhanced, and in which the notions acquired can be put to practical use.

From this viewpoint, results appear to be still a long way from achieving complete (or even extensive) coverage.

Programme changes cited included enhancing training sessions, offering more suitable shelters, revising procurement procedures to engage cost-effective services, integrating psychosocial support, installing additional lighting, designating a food distribution day for individuals with disabilities, identifying safer and more accessible locations for WASH facilities for women, improving ground insulation, transitioning from in-kind aid to cash-based interventions, promoting additional communal spaces, adjusting communication practices and cash delivery methods for households with special needs, addressing vulnerabilities, and enhancing the quality of food provided as well as refining beneficiary targeting and selection.\nIn the evaluation survey, respondents were asked to rate IOM competence in using feedback from affected people to modify programme implementation and enhance assistance: 43 per cent indicated a very high or high competence, 32 per cent gave a moderate rating, and 25 per cent rated it as low or very low. This varied perspective is supported by qualitative data: several of the IOM officers interviewed noted that considerable data are collected from affected people, but further efforts are needed to properly analyse and utilize it for informing implementation and future programme design. Others noted the lack of formal mechanisms"

While assessing impact is impossible at this stage, there are positive signs of increased involvement and engagement that might be attributable to AAP initiatives. … page 31\nDuring the course of this evaluation, several examples were gathered of AAP being effectively implemented in different operational contexts. IOM piloted the AAP Framework in Türkiye (see Case study 2), South Sudan and Nigeria. Noteworthy AAP practices have also been reported in Bangladesh (IOM, 2021c), Ethiopia (see Case study 1), Ukraine, the Response for Venezuela, Pakistan, Iraq and Somalia. In Ukraine, IOM developed several online consultation mechanisms to better reach mobile populations. In the Republic of Moldova, IOM has established a Telegram channel and has appointed a dedicated AAP officer to manage community engagements, trainings and hotlines, and to ensure the efficacy of the overall approach. \\({ }^{20}\\) In Ethiopia, a comprehensive AAP approach was developed, covering different functional and programmatic areas of the office. A common thread of the examples gathered was a strong leadership engagement, innovation and, in some cases, an expanded conception of AAP that included, for instance, actions to help increase the self-esteem of affected individuals (IOM, 2021c).\nExamples were also gathered of how engaging with affected people led to changes. In Ethiopia, it emerged that only men had access to short-term, unskilled or semi-skilled jobs (such as shelter maintenance, drainage system and water tanker installation) with partners in the camps: women within the committees advocated for equal job opportunities and this led to an increase in their participation in such roles. Also in Ethiopia, the design of shelters was modified based on women’s needs and preferences. Discussions highlighted the significance of common shelters, preferred by women as offering a better sense of safety. Concerns regarding sanitation were also resolved through open dialogues in various sessions.

In November [2023], an information session hosted on IOM Moldova’s Telegram channel, with over 1,000 members, addressed 39 questions about IOM’s assistance. The toll-free call centre at 080010877 continues to serve as the primary channel for referrals, feedback, and complaints.

However, gaps were found in the design, M&E, and relevance of some of the projects. Therefore, migrant protection, return and reintegration programming should be focused on enhancing the quality of the CBR projects in relation to the needs of the community members. Possibly, this may require larger-scale projects by a smaller sample of Implementing Partners, to ensure IOM can keep a better oversight of the project design, needs analysis and implementation.\nAdditionally, the CBR projects are an important occasion to ensure the involvement of local authorities. In line with Recommendation 1, IOM should continue focusing on enhancing ownership by local authorities through their increased engagement in CBR projects.\n\n3. Increase attention on building partnerships with service providers who can function without (significant) funding channelled by IOM. … page 29\nThe use of service providers not funded under the JI has multiple benefits to strengthen the work done under the JI. Namely, it can contribute to the capacity of service providers to support returnees; it contributes to the development and strengthening of referral systems; it contributes to policies on social security, insurance, and budgeting for service provisions; and finally, it reduces the costs of IOM. Therefore, capacity building of such existing service providers, who can function without significant financial support, can be a crucial element contributing to long-term impact and sustainability.\nTo continue strengthening partnerships, the IOM should also explore complementarity with other organisations which are focused on strengthening service provision. Namely, there is a need not only to strengthen partnerships and referrals but also to strengthen the quality of service provision in general (e.g. considering the lack of psychiatrists in Djibouti and lack of attention to mental health in most countries). Current efforts to build referral systems are not sustainable unless the service providers are able to function effectively themselves. 4. Explore opportunities for the continued (co-)funding of key, effective, and relevant activities in line with those supported under the JI-HOA. These activities include direct and specialized assistance in transit, including AVR assistance for migrants along all key migration routes from the HOA (including the Eastern, Southern, and Northern Route), an integrated approach to reintegration (individual reintegration support, CBR projects, structural level interventions) as well as support to the Regional Data Hub.\nThe work of IOM in countries of transit and destination has been noted as most relevant and important, as it directly involves the saving of lives. Therefore, the continuation of AVR support to migrants is directly linked to rescue and protection. A termination of this component, even if partial to specific migration routes, has detrimental consequences for migrants.\nThe evaluation found that the community-level approach to reintegration has been crucial for the achievements of the JI-HoA, both as standalone activities to enhance livelihoods, but also as integral component of the Integrated Approach. The effectiveness of the CBR projects to support reintegration and address drivers of irregular migration has been underlined and substantiated in this evaluation.

The JI-HoA mostly corresponds to two main pillars of the Migration policy framework for Africa and Plan of Action (2018-2030) developed by the AUC, namely, 1) migration governance; and 2) irregular migration (including returns).\nOverall, coordination between IOM and other UN agencies and NGOs led to a lack of duplications and created opportunities for complementarity. Interviewees mostly agree that duplication is hardly possible due to the scope of support needed for the return migration and the fact that the JI-HoA programme has a unique integrated approach to the return and reintegration processes.\nAn IOM regional representative shared the procedure how they were structuring the process of avoiding potential duplication across different initiatives in each country:\nWe would map out the developmental activities carried out in a given country by NGO’s, other UN agencies, etc., and try to create the link between our returnees and activities of other actors so that they could be inserted within ongoing activities.

This relates in particular to their ability to sustain themselves and their families economically.\nIn this regard, additional gains could be made by enrolling returnees back into formal education (for those who did not complete it), possibly with some allowance, and by focusing more attention to the development of entrepreneurial skills as foundation for starting sustainable (micro-)businesses. This requires additional research into the factors influencing the success of the businesses initiated by returnees under the JI. 6. Continue supporting and strengthening safe, humane, and orderly migration pathways, by providing direct support to migrants in distress, and engaging and building the capacities of key stakeholders involved in the process.\nThe most visible and important achievement of the JI-HoA has been the immediate, life-saving support provided to migrants who suffered various forms of abuse and trauma, and who did not have any other chance of returning. Currently, this evaluation believes that governments and stakeholders do not have the capacity to continue this work independently, although irregular migration continues to take place.\nHuman trafficking and abuse take place in all migration directions out of the Horn of Africa (North, East, and South) and therefore requires a continued investment in AVR in Djibouti and other transit countries from where migrants return to the HoA. Any gaps in provision of AVR has direct consequences for stranded migrants. 7. Build on the results of the IMPACT evaluation conducted under the JI-HoA by continuing to test and adjust the tools to measure reintegration sustainability and by conducting additional impact evaluations on key elements of AVRR.\nThe JI-HoA has commissioned the development of an IMPACT study which measured the sustainability of reintegration according to a predetermined methodology (RSS+).

For instance, the schedule of vocational training sessions was changed to allow easier participation by those working regular hours; the expansion or introduction of cash-based interventions in both contexts followed preferences shared by beneficiaries; the introduction of Turkish language courses followed requests from female beneficiaries; and school transportation services were adapted to better serve needs.\nExamples of insufficient or slow adaptation were also gathered. According to some stakeholders consulted, the assistance received from the cross-border programme was not always aligned with the needs of people: for example, food kits were perceived as not relevant but humanitarian programming took a long time to adjust to feedback. The assistance was perceived as following a “pre-planned” model that could not be changed easily (or at all), even if feedback was provided. Local communities were known to complain that livelihood projects were limited, demanding more structural interventions to promote economic development (something not necessarily within the scope of the ongoing interventions). Finally, the limited participation of local councils or community leaders in needs assessments was mentioned, stressing how this can affect the overall efficacy of AAP.\n\nEfficiency … page 57\nData gathered for this case study suggest that there were limited linkages between programme units and monitoring and evaluation functions. Moreover, according to an informant, monitoring and evaluation activities were sometimes left “out of the loop”. The same informant perceived that many colleagues still viewed monitoring and evaluation as an audit process rather than something that facilitates learning and project adaptation. Processes for running AAP mechanisms were generally not perceived as streamlined and a demand for more in-depth and practical AAP training was voiced, as webinars and other “virtual” forms of dissemination were not perceived as sufficient.\nSeveral informants noted that acting on some of the complaints received was more difficult than what it should have been. Answering such complaints sometimes took longer than expected and doubts persisted on what constitutes an efficient channel or solution to manage feedback efficiently. Internal coordination between different teams within IOM was seen as limited, and it was not always clear how to secure resources for concrete follow-up actions, such as sharing vehicles for reaching far away locations for beneficiary visits. Another set of difficulties identified focused on how the ability of beneficiaries to express their concerns and liaise with IOM in order to find solutions was constrained by the beneficiaries’ lack of contextual information, lack of literacy and vulnerability.\nThe limited collaboration between IOM and other United Nations partner agencies mentioned above may have had repercussions on efficiency, as well as on coherence. One informant stated that sometimes the issues raised by beneficiaries went beyond the reach of IOM, and pointed to the difficulty of coordinated responses. The same informant also explained how the lack of coordination is fatiguing for affected people, especially when similar questions are asked by different organizations, and when responses do not follow the questions (“In some"

The IOM SRF (2024) is commendable in that it shifts its focus towards outcomes, including service and programme satisfaction revised according to feedback from affected people, but there is still a need for a specific and comprehensive monitoring framework for AAP.\nThe monitoring of AAP in IOM is based on indicators included in other institutional monitoring tools rather than having its own dedicated logical framework based on a clear theory of change. The indicators used show that the focus of monitoring activities is predominantly on outputs, with targets not clearly defined and with an unclear distinction between outputs, outcomes and impacts, or objectives.\nIn the IOM Strategic Plan 2024-2028 and the IOM SRF, new AAP indicators have been included (see Annex C) that can enhance reflection on the tangible benefits of AAP. Concerning the identification of good practices, some informants in field offices expressed uncertainty on how “success stories” were identified by IOM Headquarters.\nFinding 3.5. Engagement with and awareness of AAP among senior or leadership officers is unequal, with officers in field offices being more committed to AAP than those in central functions.\nSeveral IOM officers consulted believed that senior leadership was somewhat disengaged from AAP or only marginally attentive to it. This sentiment is also reflected by the resources allocated to AAP activities at the central level, which several informants considered to be inadequate. \\({ }^{14}\\) The limited investment of core funding in AAP - with, at the time of this evaluation, the AAP Coordination Unit primarily being staffed by consultants funded by a specific USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance initiative - is perceived as a sign that implementing AAP is not a top priority for IOM.\nSenior staff consulted in field offices generally appeared to be engaged with and aware of AAP. In the IOM Ethiopia Country Office, for instance, AAP was addressed at the highest organizational level, enabling the appointment of AAP focal points for all suboffices, setting up mechanisms to share data with external partners, and holding discussions with the United Nations Country Team (see Case study 1). Conversely, the engagement of leadership at the headquarters level seemed to be confined to the initial stages, during the design and launch of the AAP Framework. This evaluation attempted to consult senior IOM Headquarters officers on this matter, but interviews did not take place due to the unavailability of the individuals contacted. \\({ }^{15}\\)\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{14}\\) This finding, gathered in 2024, backs up the 2023 MOPAN analysis regarding AAP, which concluded that IOM had not yet been able to consistently incorporate AAP across all its programmes and did not invest adequately in AAP, considering the scale of its operations. \\({ }^{15}\\) The unavailability of senior IOM Headquarters staff to be interviewed for this evaluation was interpreted as a sign of limited engagement on the matter."

    "text": "Informants confirmed that the development of the AAP Framework did not significantly involve Member States. The perspectives of Member States were not sufficiently explored for this evaluation to determine if alignment exists or not. However, IOM informants reported that a total of 225 affected persons, from different countries, participated in the consultation phase of the AAP Framework, prior to its piloting in 2018.\nIOM staff noted during interviews and in the survey that local communities may not always recognize the advantages of feedback mechanisms, or that there may be some cultural barriers to providing feedback. For example, one informant described how, in some contexts in Myanmar, giving negative feedback on assistance received may be avoided so as not to “show lack of gratitude”. Staff attempt to convey that the assistance provided is an entitlement; however, obtaining open and candid feedback may be difficult in such contexts, meaning that any application (and assessment) of AAP needs an awareness of culturally appropriate approaches.\nFinding 1.2. AAP is deemed as having general relevance for IOM, although IN/285 is specific to emergency response contexts. \\({ }^{9}\\) The AAP team has effectively promoted the framework, but there is an unmet demand for translating theoretical guidelines into more practical tools and solutions. Exchange of practical experiences between various field offices.\nThe AAP Framework has a degree of specificity to humanitarian and emergency response operations. This was found to generate confusion about the operational scope of AAP, although AAP principles and approaches were felt to be relevant also for non-emergency contexts. Some informants suggested that the focus of the current AAP Framework could be revised to strengthen connections with the Sustainable Development Goals.\nA distinction should be drawn between the AAP Framework (IN/285) and other guidance and tools available for its “operationalization” (such as the IOM AAP toolkits on participation, (2020a), on information sharing and transparency (2020b), and on CFM (2020d)). Perceptions of the Framework often differed from perceptions of the guidance and tools. Most staff interviewed during KIIs found that the Framework was helpful for defining the role of AAP and its importance for the Organization. In contrast, only half of the respondents to the global survey (Figure 3) rated the usefulness of AAP guidance and tools as very high (17%) or high (29%). Informants often felt that, while IN/285 effectively frames AAP, the tools provided and guidance available for the actual implementation of AAP approaches were not as practical as they should be.\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{9}\\) It should be noted that, since 2024, AAP has gained formal relevance across all IOM programming as its oversight was shifted from the Department of Emergencies to the Protection Division. These developments took place during the evaluation period and could not be fully reflected in the findings, but they are relevant to their interpretation."

These perceptions find confirmation from the desk review conducted for this evaluation, which identified only a relatively limited amount of public documentation and externally facing dissemination material on AAP initiatives led by IOM.\n\nCoherence … page 21\nEvaluation questions and themes for the “coherence” criterion:\n\nEQ7. Which mechanisms are in place to guarantee internal coherence for the inclusion of AAP principles and commitment in relevant IOM areas of work?\nEQ8. Does IOM effectively align its AAP interventions with United Nations and IASC AAP related guidance and mechanisms at global, regional, and national levels?\nEQ9. Are IOM AAP principles, mechanism and framework encouraging and reinforcing international and local partnerships for a comprehensive response tailored to the needs of affected populations?\nEQ11. Have IOM AAP Framework initiatives been effective to foster coordination with local and international partners for a better response, tailored to the identified needs of the affected populations?\n\nFinding 2.1. IOM pursues AAP through various frameworks and initiatives that are not always coordinated.\nAt a general level, IOM is widely receptive to the integration of AAP principles and initiatives into its interventions. AAP-related initiatives were being pursued even before AAP was formalized in IN/285, though according to one informant, AAP was probably seen as “good programming” rather than a mandatory requirement.\nAccording to most informants, the idea of actively listening to and engaging with affected people is on the way to becoming fully accepted by IOM staff. This sentiment is exemplified by one chief of mission who stated that “regular consultations are embedded in everything we do.” This finding is supported by interviews with IOM regional and country offices, where the staff consulted reported frequent engagement with affected people before interventions, during programme implementation, in post-assessment surveys, and in community programmes to run local initiatives.\nAccording to many informants - and as also confirmed by the Turkish and Ethiopian case studies - collaboration on the implementation of AAP initiatives, as well as the search for synergies between different projects, units, or departments implementing AAP, appears to be challenging in IOM. Informants interviewed from various regions, particularly those in field offices, highlighted communication challenges within IOM departments and across different thematic initiatives. Despite increasing efforts to enhance connections between AAP and PSEAH, to enhance connections between AAP and the rights-based approach, and to enhance the gathering of AAP data by the DTM unit, difficulties persist.

There were different CFMs in place and their management was primarily considered to be the responsibility of those running monitoring and evaluation processes. Other types of AAP initiatives (for example, information sharing, participation in decision-making and project adaptation) were also being undertaken, with programme teams considered directly responsible for them.\nConsultations conducted for this case study suggest that the available global guidance on AAP had limited influence in shaping the local AAP strategy and work. A need and demand for more specific guidance and tools (SOPs, “off-the-shelf” systems) was voiced: one IOM staff member interviewed said “more guidance on how to operationalize certain activities would be helpful”. Informants confirmed that IOM Türkiye received some support from IOM Headquarters in establishing AAP initiatives. At the same time, IOM Headquarters was seen by an informant as “requesting rather than providing support”, considering the balance between the amount of support available for the implementation of new policies and the requests and expectations from different departments in IOM Headquarters. In the context of the refugee response, the SOP for the cross-border operations CFM was reviewed by IOM Headquarters and the feedback received was deemed to be useful.\nIn terms of whether AAP in IOM Türkiye considered cross-cutting issues, the evaluator observed that special consideration was given to women. Concerning the inclusion of people with disabilities, some interviewees mentioned that visits were being conducted to hear their concerns and suggestions. A senior IOM staff member mentioned that disability was an area of work and concern receiving growing attention in the mission. Focal points for disability were said to have been nominated for some programmes. Conversely, no evidence that consideration was being given to environmental sustainability could be found. \\({ }^{31}\\)\nIn general, most informants did not feel that AAP was a priority for IOM Türkiye, especially as a restructuring of the office entailing a reduction of personnel was ongoing at the time of the consultations.

    "text": "A. 2 Accountability to Affected Populations in IOM Türkiye … page 53\n\nBackground … page 53\nConsultations in Türkiye took place between 4 and 8 March 2024 and were conducted by the evaluator. These entailed 12 KIIs, as well as five FGDs attended by a total of 57 individuals ( 26 women and 31 men). Consultations were conducted in the IOM Ankara Country Office and in the Gaziantep Suboffice.\nTürkiye was selected for a case study following the suggestion of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters, with the intention of focusing on AAP in the context of IOM Türkiye’s crossborder operations with Syria. The evaluator decided to also include in the scope of the consultations AAP-related initiatives undertaken for IOM Türkiye’s refugee response operations, in order to gain a more comprehensive view of AAP in the country office and to see how AAP activities undertaken by the two different programmes interrelated. Additional interviews were also held with programme officers in Ankara not working on either of the two initiatives, to gauge the extent of AAP implementation in other operational domains.\n\n\nTürkiye Context … page 53\nIn IOM Türkiye, at the time of this evaluation, there was a structured CFM specifically set up for the cross-border operations between Türkiye and Syria. This system was managed from the Gaziantep Suboffice by the cross-border programme. Another CFM was set up for the refugee response programme and was led by the monitoring and evaluation unit, also in Gaziantep. The monitoring and evaluation unit and the cross-border programme unit were observed to work quite independently of each other.\nThe monitoring and evaluation system for cross-border operations was designed in a context where implementation relied to a large extent on the implementing partners, and IOM needed an effective system to monitor progress and assess whether or not the programme activities were being executed properly. As illustrated in Figure 8, the monitoring and evaluation system was articulated in three components: a commodity tracking system; third-party monitoring; and AAP. The commodity tracking system applied a unique barcode-based identification number to every single kit delivered to beneficiaries, \\({ }^{30}\\) allowing the beneficiary to confirm whether they received the assistance or not. Third-party monitoring was implemented by Kudra Social Development Solutions, a partner with presence in both Syria and Türkiye (Gaziantep) contracted by IOM to manage beneficiary verification, distribution monitoring and exit interviews, post-distribution monitoring, and satisfaction surveys. A CFM designated as the “Dialogue, Information and Participation System” (DIPS) was established in late 2018. It consisted of a hotline together with mechanisms to share information and collect complaints and feedback via WhatsApp. Figure 8 also refers to “endorsement”: an important responsibility\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{30}\\) According to IOM Türkiye officers, the commodity tracking system tracks the movement of humanitarian supplies from the IOM warehouse in Gaziantep to the intended locations in Syria. The system allows IOM to know that a shipment reached its intended delivery location, and the specific time it did, which strengthens accountability and transparency in all distributions. Every kit released from the IOM warehouse is tagged with a unique QR code. Each QR code bears information of the type and quantity of each item included in the kit. Warehouse staff scan the QR code upon release of the kit from the warehouse. Once kits arrive in partners’ warehouses and during distributions, partners scan the QR code using GPS-enabled mobile devices. Thus, each QR code is linked to a recipient beneficiary. The data for location, date and time of distribution, and beneficiary details are automatically uploaded to a secured and encrypted server."

However, some informants felt that the demand for learning was still, to a significant extent, unmet. Most IOM staff interviewed valued the in-person AAP training sessions, feeling that these sessions helped them recognize the importance of integrating AAP into their programmes and daily practices. However, they also frequently expressed a need for more practical training and follow-up, sometimes indicating that conducting AAP training-of-trainers would be a possible solution.\nFigure 6.

Guidance and resources are missing for efficient CFM development and management, leading to duplication of effort, reduced relevance and reduced impact of the analyses produced.\nThe lack of guidance and resources for CFM implementation and management (which could potentially range from simple form “templates” to dedicated software applications with multiple functions) was frequently mentioned by informants, especially those based in country offices. In particular, this gap was perceived as severely affecting efficiency, such as through loss of information or duplication of effort.

There is a perceived gap between the rationale for undertaking AAP and its practical implications for programming that, if filled, can increase effectiveness.\nIOM advocates internally for AAP through a human rights-based approach, consistent with its global principles and values. Nevertheless, most informants interviewed noted that the AAP Framework places limited emphasis on how programme implementation can practically benefit from the feedback received from affected people. As one of them stated, “People have not realized the risk of not involving communities. It is crucial to show results [from involving affected people], not just principles. Explain to staff why they should do it.”\nSeveral respondents suggested including more AAP-related material in the next revision of the IOM Project Handbook, to bridge the gap between policy and practice more effectively. It was suggested that such integration should explicitly integrate AAP activities into the project cycle. Moreover, some suggested making the link between AAP and risk management stronger: affected people are often better positioned than IOM to make practical decisions about programme activities (for example, selecting playground locations, determining suitable livelihood options in the local context and addressing educational access challenges) and even when not, their input on these decisions is anyway essential to avoid gross operational mistakes. In this sense, it was suggested that the involvement of affected people can be framed also as a vital tool for mitigating risks inherent in humanitarian and development interventions."

The evaluators had a limited number of days to review the information, and the informants faced time and workload challenges in providing comprehensive responses and clarifications. As a result, not all of the evaluation questions could be addressed fully.\nAmong the six OECD evaluation criteria, “impact” received less focus due to the difficulty of measuring it across the various AAP policies, guidelines and initiatives. Furthermore, the theory of change was a challenging concept to elucidate because of insufficient input from relevant internal respondents, and it was therefore recommended for follow-up by the AAP Coordination Unit.\nThe evaluation team intended to interview key senior management members at IOM Headquarters, but the designated officers were unavailable. This limitation affected the inclusion of central-level senior officials’ perspectives in the findings and recommendations. Participation from senior management members in IOM country offices was, however, satisfactory.\nUltimately, another difficulty faced was the limited involvement of the AAP Coordination Unit in the evaluation process. This issue might stem from the fact that, at the time of this evaluation, an organizational restructuring process was ongoing. Moreover, this evaluation was commissioned by the CED, rather than the AAP Coordination Unit, potentially making it seem to the AAP Coordination Unit an unforeseen additional burden on already strained staff resources. Furthermore, some key IOM officers, who had been directly involved with developing the AAP Framework and coordinating related activities, had since moved to other roles, rendering them either unavailable or less available to discuss the findings and recommendations and to provide timely, detailed thematic feedback.

Instead, it examined AAP activities worldwide based on aggregated data from national, regional and global levels.\nThe intended audience for this evaluation includes IOM management, IOM staff engaged in implementing the AAP approach at Headquarters and in the field, interested donors, Member States and both international and local partners.\nThe evaluation employed the six standard criteria of the OECD Development Assistance Committee: relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability (OECD, 2024). It also incorporated an analysis of the cross-cutting themes of gender, disability, environment and human rights-based approaches, as they intersected with AAP within IOM. The complete list of evaluation questions can be found in Annex A.\n\nMethodology … page 11\nA mixed methods approach was implemented for this exercise. The triangulation of various data sources was crucial in achieving consistent and valid evaluation findings. Triangulation involves assessing multiple data sources to compare differing perspectives and ensure reliability when reporting evaluation findings, accounting for diverse viewpoints and supporting conclusions with robust evidence. The resources gathered for this exercise encompassed official IOM documents, feedback from participants at IOM and partner organizations, at local government levels, from within affected populations and from civil society organizations, where relevant, such as in the case studies.\n\nData Sources … page 11\nThe data for this evaluation were gathered using several methods: desk reviews; key informant interviews (KII); focus group discussions (FGDs); a global survey; and two case studies on AAP implementation in Ethiopia and Türkiye.\nFigure 1.

Accountability, respect, and fulfilment of the rights of migrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs), including protection, are also reflected in the Agenda on Internal Displacement and the Organization’s Strategic Vision.\nSaving lives, assisting, protecting, and working closely with all vulnerable groups and mobile populations affected by crisis are at the core of International Organization for Migration (IOM) operations. Responsive programming and project implementation in IOM require engaging affected populations in processes and decision-making early on, from needs assessments that aim to correctly identify their needs and contextual suitability including within communities, to program implementation and sustainablecompletion. The AAP Framework \\(2020^{3}\\) establishes IOM’s common approach and commitments for implementing and mainstreaming AAP and is mandatory throughout its crisis-related work as contained in its Migration Crisis Operational Framework 2012 and its Addendum of 2021. The framework was developed in line with the IASC commitments to AAP and adapted to meet IOM’s operational realities. The management of AAP in IOM is mainly the responsibility of the Department of Humanitarian Response and Recovery (DHRR), which works closely with other IOM entities for mainstreaming it, such as the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse and Sexual Harassment Unit (PSEAH).\nIOM collaborates with Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian affairs (OCHA), United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), International Federation of Red Cross (IFRC), World Food Programme (WFP), United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF), and non- governmental actors in the domain of AAP and coordinates its work and contribution via IASC timebound Task Forces (TFs), responsible for delivering the Operational Policy and Advocacy Group (OPAG)-endorsednormative work for the 2022-2023.\n\nEVALUATION OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE … page 85\nSince AAP is high on the IASC and IOM’s agendas, IOM’s Central Evaluation Unit (EVA) considered strategically relevant to perform a comprehensive assessment of IOM’s work and performance in this areaand included it in its Biennial Evaluation Plan 2023-2024. The overall objective is to evaluate IOM’s strategic, institutional, and operational approach to AAP, and to provide recommendations and lessonslearned on how to further streamline, raise awareness on and advocate for AAP principles and commitments for the populations and communities IOM serves.\nMore specifically, the evaluation will examine IOM’s global engagement with AAP in crisis-related and noncrisis settings, including its policies, strategies, and programmatic approaches set-up since 2016 (which corresponds to the issuance of new IASC policies, WHS and New York Declaration), to take stock of internal and external synergies, adaptations and institutional steps adopted by IOM for an effective andsustained approach to AAP. It will identify good practices and areas of improvement regarding IOM’s decision-making, policymaking, technical guidance, and programme implementation for a comprehensiveand collaborative AAP approach, as well as for external coherence with UN agencies, organizations, and governments.

Many organizations are asking [the same] questions - it is discouraging”).\n\nImpact and Sustainability … page 58\nNo clear sign of broad impacts stemming from AAP activities could be identified, possibly due to the way that AAP in IOM Türkiye was siloed within specific programmes, and that its purpose was understood to be more about informing project-level adaptations than supporting a broader strategy entailing cultural or organizational change across the country office. Assessing the degree to which AAP activities are promoting the empowerment of affected persons is difficult. One survey respondent from IOM Türkiye stated, “There is experience of collecting feedback, but how to evaluate impact is something we have to work on.” Another stakeholder reported how too much surveying may be detrimental to empowerment, as too much energy is devoted to asking instead of emphasizing how communities can organize themselves and address their needs. The effort put into collecting data was also seen at times as disproportionate vis-à-vis the likelihood this would have triggered change.\nThe “projectized” funding structure of the Organization, together with a prevailing culture where “aid” delivery is central, but less consideration is given to learning and the long-term sustainability of the interventions undertaken, are seen as posing fundamental obstacles to AAP mainstreaming. One survey respondent from IOM Türkiye stated that “programmes usually are defensive or dismissive when reacting to beneficiary feedback. Lack of resources for AAP units makes it difficult to follow up on feedback and causes a lack of credibility of the whole function.” This points at the need for more structural investment in AAP, with the full and continued support of IOM Türkiye’s leadership.\nThe experience of community-led projects was seen by one of the interviewees in Gaziantep as highly relevant to AAP and worthy of careful evaluation or even impact assessment, primarily to better understand issues around participation and community empowerment. There is growing awareness in the humanitarian sector of the importance of empowering local communities to be more resilient to future shocks, and this is a further reason why AAP initiatives like community-led projects are so important. \\({ }^{32}\\) The development of a communityled project involves six steps: consultation (community consultation and FGD, to understand the dynamics of the communities); design (the communities’ and stakeholders’ contributions); implementation (to ensure that activities are participatory); monitoring (using quantitative and qualitative data); handover (to the community group or government); and evaluation (to assess the results and use them to enhance community impact). Examples of community-led projects mentioned by informants include building safety areas for children, developing communal spaces such as communal tents, and breast cancer awareness activities.\nIn its engagement with community-led projects, IOM is identifying community projects and conducting a neighbourhood profile. IOM is setting up community groups and trying to identify their needs (for example, a request for the refurbishment of a bread-making company), making links and referrals to other areas (such as health or education), and giving assistance in areas\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{32}\\) See the Flagship Initiative by OCHA."

    "text": "The notion of “accountability” in AAP should always be seen as collective, in the sense that the whole humanitarian and development system should be accountable to the affected people they are supposed to serve, rather than each single organization holding that accountability individually. All actors operating in a specific context should work in concert to achieve common goals and complement each other, based on their respective roles and capabilities, and that requires collective accountability. \\({ }^{25}\\) In this evaluation, collective accountability emerged as a frequent and important concept in the narration of many informants. Instances were described in which IOM established effective communication and coordination with other United Nations agencies and partners (for example, for the joint collection, analysis and dissemination of CFM or needs data) to promote collective accountability. In other cases, scenarios of limited inter-agency communication and collaboration on AAP were described, sometimes producing cumbersome or uncertain referrals, and sometimes making it impossible to properly address reasonable needs voiced by affected people, as these did not fall within the IOM operational sphere.\nMany examples of operational changes and adaptations that were based on feedback received from affected people were gathered as part of this evaluation, suggesting that AAP initiatives have some effectiveness in informing operations. At the same time, some findings point at the need to structure or strengthen the processes that translate feedback into meaningful operational adjustments (in a timely manner), and several informants perceived that not all data gathered from affected people were being used.\nAt an aggregate level, more and more AAP engagement is taking place in IOM, as confirmed by both the prevalent perceptions of informants and by the fact that indicators used to monitor AAP in IOM are generally recording substantial improvements. It is, however, doubtful whether the current level of AAP engagement is commensurate to the size of IOM operations. Moreover, IOM does not have a formal result matrix or a theory of change for AAP; rather, it relies on a collection of indicators from different institutional monitoring frameworks, mostly focusing on outputs and on broadly defined outcomes, which makes it hard to usefully assess the implementation of AAP. Overall progress still seems insufficient to support claims of AAP mainstreaming within the Organization.\nThe opinion that resources allocated to AAP in IOM are inadequate was prevalent in both qualitative and quantitative data gathered for this evaluation. The work that led to IN/285 was funded by donors on the basis of a specific initiative. The size of the central AAP unit in IOM Headquarters was generally deemed insufficient to proactively engage with technical support, capacity-building activities including training and programme and policy development. In country offices, AAP initiatives are most often funded by and within specific projects, with their scope tailored to the requirements of the funding initiative. Some informants doubted that IOM has a strategic approach to the funding of AAP, neither at the central nor at the country\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{25}\\) Some informants pointed out the fact that collective accountability applies not only to the organizations intervening in a certain operational context, but also to their donors. According to one informant, donors sometimes push for the integration of AAP into the initiatives they fund, but then are not necessarily equipped or willing to make adjustments to their funding allocations when these would be required to follow-up on feedback received from affected people. The role of donors was not sufficiently explored in this evaluation to formulate specific findings and recommendations on this issue. It is, however, hoped that this aspect will be explored in future evaluative work."

According to the evaluation survey, 56 per cent of respondents confirmed their awareness of AAP had grown since 2021, while 80 per cent reports very high to moderate improvement in their knowledge and technical capacity regarding APP over the same period (Figure 5).\nInformants generally recognized that this progress was, at least in part, due to the training initiatives led by the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters. Informants involved in the facilitation or design of these trainings perceived them as “popular” among IOM staff based on how the response of trainees and their participation was perceived (however, neither exact figures on attendance, nor pre-training and post-training assessments were reviewed as part of this evaluation). At the same time, several informants, especially those operating in country offices, mentioned that capacity gaps persisted and lamented an often “superficial” understanding of AAP principles and concepts among the “average” IOM staffer, due to lack of practical knowledge on how to implement AAP in actual operational settings and in a nonimprovisational manner. Informants interviewed for both the IOM Türkiye and the IOM Ethiopia case studies provided similar remarks on a gap between understanding AAP and ability to implement it.\nFigure 5.

    "text": "Effectiveness … page 48\nInformants consulted for this case study largely perceived that affected communities are becoming increasingly aware of their rights and entitlements, leading to an increase in complaints and to the proactive provision of feedback. The effectiveness of the AAP Framework was evident, with instances of reports of aid diversion. In response, The IOM MEAL team investigate and implement corrective measures, including, as a last resort, the temporary suspension of aid distribution. The application of AAP to aid distribution entails the involvement of community representatives in the targeting and selection of beneficiaries, as well as the active engagement of community committees in the operationalization of CFMs.\nThe CFM reporting system utilized in camp settings was seen as effective for documenting complaints and queries from IDPs, assigning a unique number to each case for follow-up. Reports are centrally managed, analysed and shared with internal units and external partners for resolution. SMS text messaging was seen to be effective in informing beneficiaries about their entitlements. \\({ }^{28}\\)\nResort to hotline services has been growing, with utilization peaks reached during needs assessments, large-scale awareness campaigns, as well as during the onset of crises that create displacement. The hotline is a popular channel for voicing complaints, particularly for addressing sensitive issues like aid diversion, as it is easier for a caller to remain anonymous. The hotline data are also managed using a complaint-handling flow process that aligns with internal and IAAWG CFM guidance.\nSome challenges were mentioned concerning the effectiveness of hotline services. These include the fact that operators may not be familiar with all IOM interventions in the country (or those of other humanitarian actors), and that some reports inevitably go beyond the scope and reach of IOM operations. Additionally, phone network disruptions may make hotline services inaccessible, limiting the effectiveness of this channel in crisis situations where disruptions tend to be severe and protracted. Nevertheless, according to IOM Ethiopia’s complaints and feedback overview of January-June 2023, 73 per cent of complaints and feedback were addressed in a timely manner.\nRepeated complaints in IDP camps (for example, those in Tigray) on issues such as shelter maintenance, electricity and medical coverage for chronic illness (people with advanced age) to IOM and other partner organizations lead to beneficiary frustration. While some dissatisfaction stems from gaps between available support and community needs, other dissatisfaction arises from misconceptions about aid eligibility and unrealistic expectations. The comprehensive involvement of all partners, together with detailed information sharing regarding the project scope and capacity, were deemed as essential to address diverse needs comprehensively and efficiently.\nAn assessment of satisfaction with AAP mechanisms is integrated into post-distribution monitoring surveys. In the first half of 2024, 98 per cent of respondents ( \\(\\mathrm{N}=2271\\) ) reported\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{28}\\) The Socio-economic Reintegration of Ex-combatants (SERE) project piloted text messaging before the hotline was established in 2021. During this pilot phase, the hotline operation was restricted to recording messages."

IOM is following up with community groups, trying to monitor financial aspects and giving information sessions to inform about specific risks (for example, providing basic information on the proper use of fire extinguishers, communal light, and traffic safety). In the words of a staff member, “I believe community committees established, trained, and supported by IOM projects are good community systems that will ensure continued AAP beyond closure of IOM projects. Resources and capacity development need to be allocated for these committees to build their capacities and be able to continue their roles beyond projects.” Although community committees are distinct from community-led projects, they have overlapping benefits in that they are both examples of sustainable participation mechanisms which empower communities and help secure the future sustainability of the support provided by IOM.\n\nLessons Learned … page 59\n\nSenior management support was crucial to initiate AAP in IOM Türkiye. In particular, early senior management support was crucial to help set up the AAP mechanisms for cross-border operations.\nTraining courses on AAP were key for governmental buy-in on AAP. Training government partners in Ankara on AAP was key to secure support and buy-in for AAP initiatives and to create awareness of the importance of consulting communities, especially in terms of the potential for learning and adaptation.\n\n\n\nRecommendations … page 59\n\nDevelop an integrated AAP strategy for the IOM Türkiye Country Office as a whole, rather than a separate one for each programme. Place the responsibility for AAP within the programme supervision unit in collaboration with those responsible for monitoring and evaluation, and develop an office-wide strategy for IOM Türkiye, integrating the different tools for enhanced efficiency.\nIncrease coordination on AAP with other United Nations agencies and other relevant actors to foster collective accountability. Join efforts for collective accountability in Gaziantep and in Ankara or set up coordination for AAP when these are not available. Assess respondent fatigue and duplication in data collection to solve these issues as a priority.\nInvest more in community-led programmes. Change the approach from “what do you need?” to “what can we do together to improve?” Plan AAP initiatives with sustainability and empowerment in mind as opposed to only consultation on needs. Ask different questions that do not focus on needs but also on the possible contribution of affected people to change their lives and collaborate with IOM and other United Nations agencies.\nImprove in managing the expectations of affected people, while also making them more aware of the services available (such as the hotline). The AAP consultations were sometimes deemed to have led to increased expectations, which were then left unmet. Information and consultation protocols should be reviewed to better manage"

    "text": "informants suggested that, with regard to IOM distribution activities, consultations on distribution reach, quality and procedures with the affected people improved the integrity of the distribution process. These informants indicated that such AAP initiatives were taking place in IOM Türkiye.\nThe notion that AAP can lead to improvements in programme design and implementation, as well as to improved outcomes, was understood by most individuals consulted. Numerous examples were provided of past or ongoing initiatives to involve affected people in the project cycle, with a strong emphasis on the inclusion of women and people with disabilities. However, it was not always clear whether these initiatives necessarily translated into significant changes; nor was it clear that it fostered a sense of agency and empowerment among the individuals and communities involved. \\({ }^{21}\\)\nAt the field level, the evaluators came across initiatives supporting self-governance structures and participation in camp activities. Beneficiaries were encouraged to take on tasks related to on-site management and daily routines, and to running relatively small-scale projects. These initiatives were deemed as promising and relevant for enhancing the impact of AAP.\n\nSustainability … page 32\nEvaluation questions and themes for the “sustainability” criterion:\n\nEQ19. Does IOM’s participation in the United Nations and IASC mechanisms facilitate access to funding and resource mobilization related to AAP?\nEQ24. What systems are in place to address and guarantee the sustainability of IOM’s application of AAP principles and commitments in its interventions?\nEQ25. Does IOM’s engagement with governments, civil society, the United Nations, IASC and affected populations facilitate the sustainability of IOM’s support and accountability?\nEQ26. Has IOM’s integration of AAP principles in its work helped to generate stable and long-lasting participation and accountability mechanisms for people from affected marginalized groups?\n\nFinding 6.1: IN/285 constitutes a milestone achievement for sustainability, as it provides a legal basis for the IOM commitment to AAP. However, uneven leadership engagement and inadequate resourcing risk making this commitment aspirational rather than real.\nAs part of the Grand Bargain and other international commitments, IOM operates within a broader network of United Nations organizations and donors advocating for investment in AAP. Informants saw that active engagement in this environment was key to receiving dedicated funding for the development of the IOM AAP Framework. \\({ }^{22}\\) The release of IN/285\n[^0] [^0]: \\({ }^{21}\\) Some results from the global survey also suggested less than clear outcomes in this area. When staff were asked if IOM activities had successfully enhanced the participation of vulnerable populations in decision-making processes and whether they had resulted in improved well-being and empowerment, results were mixed. See Annex E for the full details on the survey results. \\({ }^{22}\\) IOM has received substantial and dedicated donor support for the development of its AAP Framework, particularly from the United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. Informants also acknowledged the benefits gained from engagement with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) while developing the institutional AAP Framework."

Such guidance could include standard CFM SOPs, template feedback forms, off-the-shelf CFM management systems and CFM data analysis dashboards, all of which should be easily adapted to and deployed in field contexts. Training material and capacity-building resources should also be expanded accordingly and should place renewed focus on practical AAP implementation. The training supply should also be expanded, as demand is currently not fully met.\nFor the follow-up to this recommendation, the following activities should be considered:\n\nDevelop practical guidance material (such as a template and guidance for AAP datasharing agreements, CFM forms, etc.) based on the requests of field-level AAP focal persons and involving the AAP community of practice.\nCritically review current training methodology and identify ways in which training effectiveness can be enhanced, and in which the notions acquired can be put to practical use. This may include on-the-job training arrangements, training follow-ups, and peer review and engagement.\nInclude AAP-related material in the current revision of the IOM Project Handbook to bridge the gap between policy and practice.\nDevelop and conduct an AAP training-of-trainer initiative.\n\nRecommendation 8: The AAP team should enhance and standardize CFM systems used in IOM through the following actions:\n\nMap existing CFM systems."

As per the IOM website, the Organization operates in 171 countries globally and has 590 offices (IOM, n.d.b). From this viewpoint, results appear to be still a long way from achieving complete (or even extensive) coverage. Although the data from the indicators and the number of IOM offices indicated on the corporate website may not be directly comparable, doubts about whether the current progress should be considered satisfactory are legitimate.\nTable 3.

Programme changes cited included enhancing training sessions, offering more suitable shelters, revising procurement procedures to engage cost-effective services, integrating psychosocial support, installing additional lighting, designating a food distribution day for individuals with disabilities, identifying safer and more accessible locations for WASH facilities for women, improving ground insulation, transitioning from in-kind aid to cash-based interventions, promoting additional communal spaces, adjusting communication practices and cash delivery methods for households with special needs, addressing vulnerabilities, and enhancing the quality of food provided as well as refining beneficiary targeting and selection.\nIn the evaluation survey, respondents were asked to rate IOM competence in using feedback from affected people to modify programme implementation and enhance assistance: 43 per cent indicated a very high or high competence, 32 per cent gave a moderate rating, and 25 per cent rated it as low or very low. This varied perspective is supported by qualitative data: several of the IOM officers interviewed noted that considerable data are collected from affected people, but further efforts are needed to properly analyse and utilize it for informing implementation and future programme design. Others noted the lack of formal mechanisms"

Did IOM’s investments in AAP institutionalization and programmes lead to immediate and medium-term results and impacts that can be identified at global, regional, and national levels?\nEQ23. Did IOM’s programmes and projects have an impact on the representation and meaningful participation of particularly vulnerable population groups (i.e., women, girls, persons with disabilities) in decision making processes?\n\n\nFinding 5.1. While assessing impact is impossible at this stage, there are positive signs of increased involvement and engagement that might be attributable to AAP initiatives. … page 31\nDuring the course of this evaluation, several examples were gathered of AAP being effectively implemented in different operational contexts. IOM piloted the AAP Framework in Türkiye (see Case study 2), South Sudan and Nigeria. Noteworthy AAP practices have also been reported in Bangladesh (IOM, 2021c), Ethiopia (see Case study 1), Ukraine, the Response for Venezuela, Pakistan, Iraq and Somalia. In Ukraine, IOM developed several online consultation mechanisms to better reach mobile populations. In the Republic of Moldova, IOM has established a Telegram channel and has appointed a dedicated AAP officer to manage community engagements, trainings and hotlines, and to ensure the efficacy of the overall approach. \\({ }^{20}\\) In Ethiopia, a comprehensive AAP approach was developed, covering different functional and programmatic areas of the office. A common thread of the examples gathered was a strong leadership engagement, innovation and, in some cases, an expanded conception of AAP that included, for instance, actions to help increase the self-esteem of affected individuals (IOM, 2021c).\nExamples were also gathered of how engaging with affected people led to changes. In Ethiopia, it emerged that only men had access to short-term, unskilled or semi-skilled jobs (such as shelter maintenance, drainage system and water tanker installation) with partners in the camps: women within the committees advocated for equal job opportunities and this led to an increase in their participation in such roles. Also in Ethiopia, the design of shelters was modified based on women’s needs and preferences. Discussions highlighted the significance of common shelters, preferred by women as offering a better sense of safety. Concerns regarding sanitation were also resolved through open dialogues in various sessions.

What is presented in this section should be taken as simply illustrative and preparatory to the definition of future impact assessments focusing on AAP activities, which the authors highly encourage IOM to undertake. \\({ }^{20}\\) IOM Moldova Telegram channel. According to the IOM situation report from Moldova for October-December 2023, “IOM continues to mainstream AAP through online information sessions, a toll-free call centre and community information centres, offering comprehensive information on IOM project activities, available support and acting as a platform for receiving complaints, feedback, and referrals. In November [2023], an information session hosted on IOM Moldova’s Telegram channel, with over 1,000 members, addressed 39 questions about IOM’s assistance. The toll-free call centre at 080010877 continues to serve as the primary channel for referrals, feedback, and complaints. Throughout the reporting period, a total of 1,433 calls were received, with most inquiries focusing on rental assistance, cash assistance, and legal support” (IOM, 2023e:6)."

Activities such as training a community committee to disseminate information, collect and convey feedback, or verify targeted beneficiaries have been observed to lead to positive feedback about IOM responsiveness to the community’s needs, and to mitigate risks such as aid diversion. The development of AAP guidance, SOPs and other key documents benefited greatly from participatory processes with field colleagues. For example, the SOPs for the integration of AAP and PSEAH in cash and in-kind interventions were discussed, amended and validated during a full day workshop with the AAP focal points from the different suboffices, to ensure they are operational and adapted to field offices’ capacities and contexts.
