According to the majority of surveyed stakeholders, the JI effectively reached out to migrants who would otherwise not be in a position to return home ( $87 \%$, exceeding the target of $70 \%$ ). Similarly, $95 \%$ of surveyed migrants reported that they have been provided with sufficient and useful information to take an informed decision to return, which exceeded the target of $70 \% .{ }^{65}$

Desk review of project documents, the interviews with IOM staff, stakeholders, and returnees themselves confirmed that the JI allowed for safe, humane, and dignified return of migrants while taking into consideration their needs and vulnerabilities. Returnees involved in the Focus Groups noted specifically that "their return would not have been possible without IOM". ${ }^{66}$ The development of a Regional MRC strategy with 40 partner organisations has been an important achievement of the JI's efforts. ${ }^{67}$

Some evidence has been found of the involvement of governments in AVR, in terms of direct assistance to MRCs, cancelling exit fees and penalties in host countries, and direct contributions to return flights. ${ }^{68}$ However, it is important to note that the JI staff (and JI-funded staff) were the main responsible actors to facilitate the return process. Therefore, whether return processes have actually become safer, more humane and more dignified in general (without the support of IOM) is unclear. Namely, as presented above and in the sustainability section, key stakeholders still lack important capacity to work on return independently.

#### 4.3.3. Specific Objective 3: Returnees are sustainably integrated in host communities, and host communities are better able to create living standards that address drivers of migration. ... page 20

The third Specific Objective focuses on the reintegration process. This area includes numerous activities focused on support to returnees, community-based projects, and monitoring. It is expected that these activities contribute to the economic, social, and psychosocial reintegration of returnees while simultaneously enhance livelihoods in the communities. This Outcome also includes the establishment of proper M\&E systems to track the needs of returnees, which should lead to reinforced data collection systems. Overall, the results should contribute to sustainable reintegration in communities that are able to create living standards that address drivers of migration.

By September 2022, the JI had provided reintegration assistance to a total of 15161 beneficiaries, with an original target of 12800 . The JI aimed for declared satisfaction with reintegration support among $70 \%$ of returnees, although it reached an average satisfaction rate of $55 \%$ across the three countries of
