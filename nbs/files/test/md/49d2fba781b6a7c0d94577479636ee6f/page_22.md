institutions were supported to establish or strengthen data collection, monitoring and/or learning tools, compared to the target of 27 .

Throughout the JI, the programme has implemented activities to harmonize the approach to monitoring and measuring the impact of return and reintegration assistance, and associated tools for data collection across the three countries of origin. Enumerators in IOM country offices (and universities in Ethiopia) conducted AVR, reintegration assistance, and reintegration sustainability surveys, the results of which were collected regionally in the MiMOSA database for analysis. The EU-IOM Joint Initiative also strengthened data collection, analysis, and dissemination on reintegration through development of database applications, provision of equipment and training to the relevant government institutions. ${ }^{75}$

The unmet targets regarding the support to institutions in Ethiopia are explained by the IOM as owing to the prolonged process required to ensure ownership of the government entities involving in the development of return and reintegration database in Ethiopia, which is envisaged to be used as a national database. ${ }^{76}$ The Partnership Analysis noted that similar initiatives with new software applications in Sudan were delayed due to the political turmoil. Somalia was the only country where a returnee registration and certification system could be deployed, in collaboration with the Somaliland National Displacement and Refugee Agency (NDRA). ${ }^{77}$

By September 2022, more than $99 \%$ of returnees referred to state and non- state actors were assisted by those actors, exceeding the target of $70 \%$. At least $89 \%$ of returnees in all countries (with an overall average of $93 \%$ ) reported sufficient levels of economic self-sufficiency, social stability and psychosocial wellbeing in their community of return (also exceeding the target of $70 \%$ ). ${ }^{78}$

The extent to which returnees considered themselves effectively reintegrated differs between persons. In a Sudanese FGD with returnees, the majority of participants reported a good level of reintegration in the community. ${ }^{79}$ A FGD with Somalian returnees also found that the majority considered themselves reintegrated. ${ }^{80}$ However, some respondents noted that they do not feel reintegrated, mostly due to their mental health (e.g. "I feel that I haven't landed yet. I feel like I am still in Libya"). ${ }^{81}$

While the IMPACT study showed visible changes in the economic situation of beneficiaries, all three countries show a similar trend where the economic reintegration score is lowest, and psychosocial is the highest. ${ }^{82}$ Interviews with stakeholders and Focus Group Discussions with returnees in the programme countries point out that their country's dire economic situation severely hinders their
