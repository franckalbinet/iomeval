- Desk research for data collection and analysis was carried out during the structured fieldwork stage. During this phase, the evaluation team focused on specific questions set out in the evaluation grid and focus on the triangulation of the secondary and primary data sources.

To gather the insights of key stakeholders of the JI, the evaluation team conducted interviews at country-level (led by national experts) and with regional and global stakeholders, IOM staff, and donors (led by the core evaluation team).

- Eight Inception Interviews were carried out, including four regional IOM staff interviews and four group interviews with the four IOM country teams.
- 52 interviews were carried out with 78 stakeholders, including six interviews with regional stakeholders and 46 interviews with 72 national-level stakeholders (in Ethiopia, most interviews were group interviews)
- 21 interviews were implemented with 30 IOM staff at national and regional level

To gather more comprehensive, in-depth qualitative insights on the experiences of the beneficiaries (migrants, returnees, and community members), the evaluation team organized focus group discussions in each country. Four FGDs were held in Ethiopia, Sudan, and Somalia, and one FGD in Djibouti.

The final debriefing workshop, focused on dissemination of the findings and conclusions of the evaluation, helped the evaluation team to validate the findings of the evaluation and collect valuable reflections from IOM staff. The findings from the debriefing were integrated to the final evaluation report.

The evaluation was based on numerous consultations with stakeholders and IOM staff, and extensive review of documentation. However, certain external and internal factors influenced the implementation of the evaluation:

- The political and security situation in the programme countries prevented the team from exploring some of the programme implementation localities. In Ethiopia, the Tigray region and Amhara region were deemed not safe to visit, and in Somalia, the FGD in Burao was cancelled due to renewed security/political risks. Similarly, restrictions on travel in Sudan led the team to conduct one online FGD, one FGD where returnees were brought to Khartoum, and one region to be replaced with another FGD in Khartoum.
- Not all selected stakeholders were able or willing to make themselves available for an interview. Fortunately, these only comprised a few stakeholders across the region.
