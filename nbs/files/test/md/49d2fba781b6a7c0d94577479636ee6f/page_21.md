The majority of returnees were satisfied with the support received. Some returnees indicated that the economic support was crucial for them as they returned "with nothing". The support helped them to start a business or search for employment and helped them create new social networks. ${ }^{89}$ The majority of FGD participants in Sudan were satisfied with medical, psychosocial support, and social support. ${ }^{70}$

Focus Groups with returnees demonstrate that the main factors causing dissatisfaction related to the insufficiency of economic support. ${ }^{71}$ For example, several Somalian returnees believed that the economic support was too little. Similarly, a FGD in Sudan concluded that "the total budget allocated to the income generation projects is not sufficient to start projects/generate income to support a family."72 The Year 4 Interim Report noted in this regard the adverse impact of devaluation and difference between the official and "black market" exchange rates in Sudan in 2021 which brought down the pre-2021 average.

Additionally, 54 community-based reintegration projects were initiated. These projects have supported approximately 76,348 community and returnee beneficiaries. ${ }^{73}$ Itad's "Spot Analytical Report \#1 -Community-based Reintegration Projects (CBRPs)" study found that the majority of the CBR projects were well-designed with plausible outcomes, focusing mainly on capacity building and livelihood support. ${ }^{74}$
