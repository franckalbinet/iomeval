Outreach and awareness ... page 19

According to IOM's logframe, IOM conducted five times more awareness raising activities/events addressing migrants in target countries than expected.

A stakeholder in Djibouti noted that the JI was effective in providing migration related information in Obock and outside. "They are consistently briefing the migrants about the possible dangers of migration". ${ }^{59}$ IOM Ethiopia organised awareness raising on sexual and gender-based violence to migrant returnees and host community members as part of the programme's gender mainstreaming effort within the reintegration process. ${ }^{60}$

The current evaluation did not find guidelines for awareness raising and outreach that would ensure a harmonized approach across countries. Additionally, no information was found in project documents and logframes on the exact objectives of awareness raising (i.e. this dimension did not have its own objectives, indicators and impact studies). It was not subject to specific evaluation under the JI-HoA.

Assistance to stranded migrants ... page 19

Three indicators were designed to measure achievements regarding AVR. The JI supported 9025 migrants to return voluntarily to their countries of origin (against a target of 8450), and provided 8960 migrants in transit with protection and direct assistance (against a target of 8450 .

Additionally, between 2017-2022, the JI built, enhanced, rehabilitated or rented a total of 15 MRCs, thereby exceeding its target of 12 . Besides the number of migrants supported, the AVR monitoring survey found that $95 \%$ of assisted migrants were satisfied with travel arrangements made for them (exceeding the target of $70 \%$ ) and $99.6 \%$ of surveyed returnees felt that travel was well-organised and safe. ${ }^{61}$

The 2019 mid-term evaluation noted that stakeholders in both Somalia and Sudan were concerned about the long waiting times for AVR (often due to external factors), which in some cases have led to migrants choosing alternative ways to return. During the current evaluation, a Somalian stakeholder pointed out that voluntary return procedures still tend to take too long, creating difficulties for returnees. ${ }^{62}$ However, there are some factors (e.g. approval by the Ethiopian government, COVID-19 restrictions, conflicts) that can hinder the swift AVR of migrants beyond the control of IOM or the JI). ${ }^{63}$ In Djibouti stakeholders noted that return procedures have improved as voluntary return procedures and documentation of migrants was sped up allowing for quicker return processes. ${ }^{64}$
