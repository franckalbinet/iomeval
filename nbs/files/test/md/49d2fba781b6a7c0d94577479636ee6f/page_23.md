economic reintegration. As mentioned above, many returnees were glad to receive economic assistance, but deemed it too little to become economically reintegrated. ${ }^{83}$

At the same time, community members who attended the FGDs noted that CBR projects contributed positively to economic and employment opportunities in the community. $92 \%$ of surveyed community members reported that they feel involved in the identification, design and/or implementation of community-based reintegration, exceeding the $70 \%$ target.

Besides the extent of economic, social, and psychosocial reintegration of returnees as a result of the JIHoA intervention, the IMPACT study also measured the sustainability of reintegration. The IMPACT study was the first impact evaluation to use IOM's metric of sustainable reintegration, the Reintegration Sustainability Index (RSI). The RSI was further adjusted based on literature reviews, which resulted in an enhanced version of the institutional questionnaire, called RSS+. ${ }^{84}$

However, the methodology to assess the sustainability of reintegration is rather new and still subject to testing and improvement. Therefore, adjustments in measuring reintegration sustainability were made during the IMPACT study, considering the score threshold. The outcome of the RSS against the Reintegration Sustainability Score shows that a large difference exists between the use of the 0.5 and the 0.66 threshold. Using the former approach, $92 \%$ of the respondents recorded a score higher than the 0.5 threshold. Using the 0.66 threshold, only $53 \%$ of the respondents would be considered as having attained "sufficient levels of economic self-sufficiency, social stability and psychosocial wellbeing in their community of return".

Based on the combined information gathered from desk research, interviews and Focus Group Discussions, and the assessment of the results achieved, the evaluation can conclude that the integrated approach itself is of great importance to sustainable reintegration. However, factors external to the JI hindered the integrated approach from being effectively implemented at all levels.

Stakeholders noted, in particular, the combination of individual reintegration support and CBR projects, aimed to create better cohesion in communities and enable communities to support the reintegration process. Interviews and focus groups conducted for this evaluation also noted that
