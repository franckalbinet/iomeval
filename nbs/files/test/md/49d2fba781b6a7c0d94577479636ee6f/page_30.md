components of support for reintegration, and would be significantly weakened if certain components were removed.

The work of the Regional Data Hub was highly appreciated by stakeholders and the activities of the hub were effective in enhancing knowledge on migration, harmonizing methodologies and indicators, and building capacities for data collection and management. There is a clear interest of stakeholders to continue working with the RDH on improving research and data in the region.

It is strongly recommended that IOM explores funding sources to ensure the continuation of the aforementioned activities. IOM should explore, for example, opportunities for funding and cooperation under the inter-agency framework established under the Migrant Response Plan for the Horn of Africa and Yemen.

#### 5. Explore opportunities to extend the scope of support provided to returnees, with a focus on longer-term integration.  ... page 30

While the emergency support on arrival (cash, medical services, MHPSS) was deemed highly relevant, important, and effective, the evaluation has shown that returnees still struggle with sustainable reintegration. This relates in particular to their ability to sustain themselves and their families economically.

In this regard, additional gains could be made by enrolling returnees back into formal education (for those who did not complete it), possibly with some allowance, and by focusing more attention to the development of entrepreneurial skills as foundation for starting sustainable (micro-)businesses. This requires additional research into the factors influencing the success of the businesses initiated by returnees under the JI.
6. Continue supporting and strengthening safe, humane, and orderly migration pathways, by providing direct support to migrants in distress, and engaging and building the capacities of key stakeholders involved in the process.

The most visible and important achievement of the JI-HoA has been the immediate, life-saving support provided to migrants who suffered various forms of abuse and trauma, and who did not have any other chance of returning. Currently, this evaluation believes that governments and stakeholders do not have the capacity to continue this work independently, although irregular migration continues to take place.

Human trafficking and abuse take place in all migration directions out of the Horn of Africa (North, East, and South) and therefore requires a continued investment in AVR in Djibouti and other transit countries from where migrants return to the HoA. Any gaps in provision of AVR has direct consequences for stranded migrants.
7. Build on the results of the IMPACT evaluation conducted under the JI-HoA by continuing to test and adjust the tools to measure reintegration sustainability and by conducting additional impact evaluations on key elements of AVRR.

The JI-HoA has commissioned the development of an IMPACT study which measured the sustainability of reintegration according to a predetermined methodology (RSS+). As the report mentions, the measurement of reintegration sustainability through preset indicators is rather new and
