#### 4.2.1. The JI-HoA's alignment with the objectives and standards of IOM, and objectives of the EU  ... page 14

The EU-IOM JI-HoA aligns with the purpose of IOM as described in its constitution. Providing assistance services for voluntary return migration is a core function of the organisation to ensure safe, orderly and dignified migration ${ }^{36}$. IOM's international norms and standards regarding AVRR are centred around protecting migrants' rights (to a safe and dignified return) and achieving sustainable reintegration. One of the main principles for IOM regarding AVRR, namely voluntariness, was followed by organizing information sessions of the AVRR programme. ${ }^{37}$.

The JI-HoA corresponds to the existing EU foreign policy documents and political trajectories. The EUIOM JI-HoA contributed to the objectives of the EU Trust Fund for Africa to emphasise greater economic and employment opportunities and improve migration management in countries of origin and transit. The JI-HoA is also aligned with the Valletta Action Plan, a framework for migration governance between Europe and Africa specifically addressing irregular migration in three regions, including the Horn of Africa, aimed at tackling migrant smugglers, fostering safe return and reintegration, migrant protection and effective governance of irregular migration ${ }^{38}$.

Similarly, the JI-HoA contributed to the European Agenda on Migration's objectives, namely the focus on reducing incentives for irregular migration. The objective aims to track and eliminate the causes of irregular migration by developing regional cooperation frameworks, such as the Khartoum Process. A specific objective of the European Agenda, addressed by the JI-HoA, is the improvement of the EU's return system through the sustainable approach to assisting return migration. ${ }^{39}$

Lastly, while the project countries did not have comprehensive return and reintegration policies in place for the JI-HoA to strengthen/align with, national governments had developed broader strategies such as development plans, poverty reduction strategies and similar documents, to which objectives the JIHoA would also ultimately contribute.

#### 4.2.2. Alignment with other initiatives ... page 14

The analysis of interviews with IOM staff, stakeholders and desk research revealed that IOM put sufficient efforts in mapping activities of different actors in each country to avoid duplication. Therefore, generally there were no duplication across different projects, rather examples of complementary support initiatives.
