##### Relevance ... page 55

AAP as a concept is relevant for IOM Türkiye and there was growing awareness of it, although not uniformly across all thematic areas and programmes. There were different CFMs in place and their management was primarily considered to be the responsibility of those running monitoring and evaluation processes. Other types of AAP initiatives (for example, information sharing, participation in decision-making and project adaptation) were also being undertaken, with programme teams considered directly responsible for them.

Consultations conducted for this case study suggest that the available global guidance on AAP had limited influence in shaping the local AAP strategy and work. A need and demand for more specific guidance and tools (SOPs, "off-the-shelf" systems) was voiced: one IOM staff member interviewed said "more guidance on how to operationalize certain activities would be helpful". Informants confirmed that IOM Türkiye received some support from IOM Headquarters in establishing AAP initiatives. At the same time, IOM Headquarters was seen by an informant as "requesting rather than providing support", considering the balance between the amount of support available for the implementation of new policies and the requests and expectations from different departments in IOM Headquarters. In the context of the refugee response, the SOP for the cross-border operations CFM was reviewed by IOM Headquarters and the feedback received was deemed to be useful.

In terms of whether AAP in IOM Türkiye considered cross-cutting issues, the evaluator observed that special consideration was given to women. Concerning the inclusion of people with disabilities, some interviewees mentioned that visits were being conducted to hear their concerns and suggestions. A senior IOM staff member mentioned that disability was an area of work and concern receiving growing attention in the mission. Focal points for disability were said to have been nominated for some programmes. Conversely, no evidence that consideration was being given to environmental sustainability could be found. ${ }^{31}$

In general, most informants did not feel that AAP was a priority for IOM Türkiye, especially as a restructuring of the office entailing a reduction of personnel was ongoing at the time of the consultations. A senior staff member of IOM Türkiye mentioned that expectations from donors in terms of AAP often did not correspond to the resources made available for the implementation of these initiatives and for monitoring and evaluation more generally.

##### Coherence ... page 55

Limited coherence and coordination of AAP activities across different programmes could be observed. Internal reporting lines for AAP differed across different programmes, and were subject to change. AAP initiatives were in some cases perceived as advanced and comprehensive, although also fragmented, with no apparent effort to find synergies between them.
