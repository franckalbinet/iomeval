questioned whether IOM was living up to its potential, arguing that more could be done to ensure AAP initiatives are coordinated with partners and made visible. These perceptions find confirmation from the desk review conducted for this evaluation, which identified only a relatively limited amount of public documentation and externally facing dissemination material on AAP initiatives led by IOM.

### Coherence  ... page 21

Evaluation questions and themes for the "coherence" criterion:

- EQ7. Which mechanisms are in place to guarantee internal coherence for the inclusion of AAP principles and commitment in relevant IOM areas of work?
- EQ8. Does IOM effectively align its AAP interventions with United Nations and IASC AAP related guidance and mechanisms at global, regional, and national levels?
- EQ9. Are IOM AAP principles, mechanism and framework encouraging and reinforcing international and local partnerships for a comprehensive response tailored to the needs of affected populations?
- EQ11. Have IOM AAP Framework initiatives been effective to foster coordination with local and international partners for a better response, tailored to the identified needs of the affected populations?

Finding 2.1. IOM pursues AAP through various frameworks and initiatives that are not always coordinated.

At a general level, IOM is widely receptive to the integration of AAP principles and initiatives into its interventions. AAP-related initiatives were being pursued even before AAP was formalized in IN/285, though according to one informant, AAP was probably seen as "good programming" rather than a mandatory requirement.

According to most informants, the idea of actively listening to and engaging with affected people is on the way to becoming fully accepted by IOM staff. This sentiment is exemplified by one chief of mission who stated that "regular consultations are embedded in everything we do." This finding is supported by interviews with IOM regional and country offices, where the staff consulted reported frequent engagement with affected people before interventions, during programme implementation, in post-assessment surveys, and in community programmes to run local initiatives.

According to many informants - and as also confirmed by the Turkish and Ethiopian case studies - collaboration on the implementation of AAP initiatives, as well as the search for synergies between different projects, units, or departments implementing AAP, appears to be challenging in IOM. Informants interviewed from various regions, particularly those in field offices, highlighted communication challenges within IOM departments and across different thematic initiatives. Despite increasing efforts to enhance connections between AAP and PSEAH, to enhance connections between AAP and the rights-based approach, and to enhance the gathering of AAP data by the DTM unit, difficulties persist. As one informant stated, "IOM thoroughly engages with affected populations, but there is not unity between what is done by
