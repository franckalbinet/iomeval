Horizontal bar chart showing barriers or challenges ranked by frequency or importance. The chart displays 11 categories with 'Capacity Building/Training' and 'Staff/Resource Availability' as the top two barriers with the longest bars extending nearly to the right edge. 'Governance/Guidelines' shows moderate length at approximately 40% of maximum. Mid-range barriers include 'I don't know/Not aware', 'Tools Availability', 'Frontline Action/Local', and 'Stakeholder Coordination'. The shortest bars represent 'CFM', 'Accountability/Commitment', 'Other', and 'Communication/Awareness' at the bottom. The bars are uniformly colored in dark blue, and the chart uses a simple grid layout with vertical gridlines for reference. This appears to be survey or assessment data related to organizational or programmatic challenges.
