Recommendation 4: The senior management and the Protection Division should strengthen central AAP functions, ensuring that the size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters becomes adequate for meeting AAP strategic objectives and that there is capacity to proactively support country offices in structuring their approach to AAP implementation.

For the follow-up to this recommendation, the following activity should be considered:

- Increase staff resources in regional offices, establishing AAP-dedicated positions or designating focal persons with both technical knowledge and time capacity, ${ }^{26}$ ensuring these have a clear mandate to undertake AAP tasks effectively and efficiently, and that technical reporting lines to AAP officers in IOM Headquarters are established.

Recommendation 5: The AAP team should support country offices in developing office-wide approaches to AAP implementation and funding, reducing fragmentation.

This recommendation should be based on known cases of office-wide approaches to AAP, such as IOM Ethiopia (Case study 1), where AAP functions are centralized in a specific unit, a network of AAP focal persons has been established, and funding for AAP activities is regularly included in and taken from different initiatives proportional to their budget.

Central AAP functions should establish minimum standards for operating AAP at the country level and should provide different models for the funding and centralization of AAP functions, taking into account different country office sizes, specializations and operational contexts.

For the follow-up to this recommendation, the following activities should be considered:

- Develop specific guidance on AAP system development in country offices, including funding methodologies.
- Establish a fund for supporting select country offices to cover the start-up costs of integrated, office-wide AAP systems. Select recipients of support through open competition

Recommendation 6: The Protection Division and the AAP team should increase the visibility of AAP activities, both internally and externally, on the basis of a clear visibility and knowledge management plan.

The desk review of AAP documentation clearly indicated that an insufficient amount of "visibility" material, including case studies and AAP best practice documentation, has been produced to document AAP activities and their influence on the work of IOM.

It is key that efforts on AAP visibility are formalized in a dedicated plan, formulated by the AAP central unit in coordination with communication specialists, and that country offices are provided with guidance, tools and support on AAP best practices around documentation and visibility.
