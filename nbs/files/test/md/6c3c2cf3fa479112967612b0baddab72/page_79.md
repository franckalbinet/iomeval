This is a survey or assessment table with a rating scale structure. The table has a blue header row with 'Question' on the left and numbered columns 1-5 on the right, plus two additional columns labeled 'I don't know/Not applicable'. The left column contains five questions related to Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP): 1) Senior leadership support to AAP, 2) Donor support to AAP, 3) Participatory mechanisms in place at IOM's field operations (both in emergency and development contexts), 4) External partners' support for APP in IOM, and 5) Visibility of IOM's work on AAP for external partners. The table appears to be a Likert-scale assessment tool where respondents would rate each question on a scale of 1-5, with an option to indicate if they don't know or if the question is not applicable.
