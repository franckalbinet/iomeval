  "sections": "## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  ... page 6\n\nThis external evaluation assessed whether or not IOM is delivering on its commitments to accountability to affected populations (AAP), ${ }^{1}$ following findings from the 2023 MOPAN assessment indicating that the Organization has not yet been able to consistently incorporate AAP across all its programmes, and did not invest adequately in AAP, considering the scale of its operations. In addition to a review of both internal and public documents related to AAP, data collection methods included consultations with a relatively large number of individuals (IOM staff members, predominantly), through key informant interviews (KIIs), focus group discussions (FGDs) and an online survey. The findings mainly reflect the perceptions of the individuals consulted, rather than being based on technical assessments of specific aspects of AAP work, as these were beyond the scope of this evaluation.\n\nThe main object of analysis was the overall IOM AAP Framework (constituted by Instruction 285 (IN/285) and the body of guidance and resources available to guide and support AAP activities) and the activities implemented by the AAP Coordination Unit in Headquarters to implement the AAP policy. AAP activities implemented at a country office level were not systematically reviewed, except for two case studies on AAP implementation, in IOM Ethiopia and IOM T\u00fcrkiye. Findings on decentralized activities are therefore based on these two case studies and from the examples provided by the individuals consulted, which combined form a partial representation of decentralized AAP implementation in IOM.\n\nThe key findings of the evaluation are:\n\n- The IOM AAP Framework is highly relevant, generally coherent and solidly centred around Instruction 285, with the caveat that its focus on emergency operations leaves many unclear on the mandatory nature of AAP in non-emergency contexts, where AAP principles are felt as equally applicable and where AAP-related activities are already being implemented.\n- Resources allocated to central AAP functions remain inadequate. The AAP Coordination Unit is largely funded with earmarked funds and staffed by ungraded staff or consultants. Resources available are generally deemed to be insufficient to meet the demand for learning and to proactively support IOM country offices. Informants overwhelmingly indicated that more practical resources and hands-on support are needed for effective and efficient AAP implementation at the field level.\n- There is no formal strategy, plan, or monitoring and evaluation framework to guide the implementation of AAP from a central level. AAP is currently monitored through a collection of indicators included in the IOM Strategic Result Framework and its related plan. These indicators have recorded significant growth in recent years, but they are not assessed against clear targets, they focus on outputs and very broadly defined outcomes, and they do not collectively constitute a robust policy monitoring\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{1}$ IOM follows the IASC definition of AAP, which describes AAP as \"an active commitment to use power responsibly by taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the people humanitarian organisations seek to assist\" (IASC, 2015).\n\nframework. There is clear progress in the implementation of AAP within IOM, but any claim of \"AAP mainstreaming\" within the Organization cannot be reasonably demonstrated.\n\n- At a decentralized level, there are examples of IOM being able to set up articulated systems and initiatives that promote AAP, with tangible effects on operations. However, sustaining and scaling up these initiatives is challenging. AAP implementation at the level of IOM country offices is predominantly undertaken in the context of specific projects or thematic areas. This may often lead to a \"fragmented approach\" where solutions and activities implemented in one area are not necessarily replicated or extended to other relevant ones. The case of IOM Ethiopia stood out as an important attempt at \"institutionalising\" AAP in the country office structure, as well as devising a mechanism to fund AAP activities from all ongoing projects in the mission.\n- There are known gaps that reduce the effectiveness and efficiency of activities promoting AAP at a decentralized level. These include a lack of full integration of AAP into the IOM project cycle; a lack of standard solutions and technical resources for the development and management of complaint and feedback mechanism (CFM) systems; a lack of technical resources and support to make full use of data gathered from affected people; and, finally, a lack of capacity to engage with other actors to promote \"collective accountability\".\n\nIn conclusion, the evaluation largely confirms the findings from the 2023 MOPAN assessment, while also drawing a more nuanced and detailed picture of how IOM is pursuing its institutional commitments regarding AAP. Nine recommendations are put forward for IOM senior management and for the AAP team, to address the gaps identified:\n\n1. Clarify that the scope and applicability of AAP extends beyond emergency response operations, reinforcing also the message on the mandatory nature of $\\mathrm{IN} / 285$.\n2. Develop an operational medium- to longer-term strategy for AAP, to be negotiated at the highest leadership level, with a three-year plan connected to a funding strategy.\n3. In conjunction with Recommendation 2 (develop an AAP strategy), develop a theory of change and a dedicated monitoring and evaluation framework for AAP.\n4. Strengthen central AAP functions, ensuring that the size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters becomes adequate to meet AAP strategic objectives and that there is capacity to proactively support country offices to structure their approach to AAP implementation.\n5. Support country offices in developing office-wide approaches to AAP implementation and funding, reducing fragmentation.\n6. Increase the visibility of AAP activities, both internally and externally, on the basis of a clear visibility and knowledge management plan.\n\n7. Increase training opportunities and update capacity-building material with increased focus on practical AAP implementation and including standard tools and templates, which will have been developed in consultation with relevant field offices, partners and community of practice members.\n8. Map CFM systems in use in IOM, through establishing minimum standards and quality control systems, developing and disseminating dedicated guidance material, and standardizing CFM systems and their integration into corporate systems.\n9. Continue collaboration and engagement on collective accountability, actively participating in coordination structures on AAP, such as IASC-promoted initiatives or initiatives developed in other inter-agency coordination spaces, both at the global and country level.\n## 2. EVALUATION FINDINGS  ... page 16\n\n### Relevance ... page 16\n\nEvaluation questions and themes for the \"relevance\" criterion: ${ }^{5}$\n\n- EQ1. To what extent is IOM's AAP approach relevant and aligned with the needs and priorities of IOM Member States and the United Nations system (IASC commitments in particular), and of the affected populations and beneficiaries IOM assist?\n- EQ2. Are IOM's AAP mechanisms and guidance relevant for IOM offices to enable programming and implementation of AAP in its interventions?\n- EQ3. How does IOM's AAP approach consider IOM cross-cutting issues of human rights, gender equality, disability and environment? ${ }^{6}$\n- EQ4. To what extent were \"relevant marginalized groups\" defined/identified by rights-holders themselves?\n- EQ5. Are there institutional comparative advantages for AAP approach, which can be identified in the Organization's mandate, to support further advancement in the fields of AAP?\n- EQ6. What mechanisms are in place to guarantee that the design and implementation of IOM interventions address power dynamics between affected populations and local and international entities?\n\nFinding 2.3 The IOM AAP Framework is consistent with general United Nations guidance and IASC policies, and there is evidence that affected people were involved in the framework's development. However, the alignment with Member States' perspectives remains unclear, as this aspect was not emphasized during the development of the framework.\n\nThis evaluation found that the IOM AAP Framework (IN/285) aligns with IASC guidance (as well as with similar frameworks in place in other entities), through desk review and informants consulted on the matter. The development of the framework entailed thorough reviews of IASC policies and other relevant IOM policies, with the aim of achieving substantial conceptual and theoretical consistency with them. ${ }^{7}$ Some informants also identified that the framework is also relevant to the implementation of the \"We Are All In\" reporting platform (a flagship initiative in IOM), as it contributes to raising awareness about reporting mechanisms.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{5}$ The full list of evaluation questions, together with indicators, collection methods and data sources, can be found in the evaluation matrix (Annex A). Evaluation questions are reproduced directly from the terms of reference of the evaluation.\n    ${ }^{6}$ This list of cross-cutting issues was provided by IOM in the terms of reference for the evaluation; thus, the evaluation does not address how the IOM AAP approach intersects with other cross-cutting issues such as the rights of gender non-binary migrants, children or the elderly, linguistic or cultural minorities.\n    ${ }^{7}$ IOM policies and guidelines considered as relevant for or related to IN/285 include the IOM Migration Crisis Operational Framework (MC/2355), the IOM Humanitarian Policy - Principles for Humanitarian Action (C/106/CRP/20), the IOM Standards of Conduct (IN/15, Rev. 1), the IOM Guidance note for mainstreaming protection in IOM crisis response (IN/232), the IOM Policies and Procedures for Preventing and Responding to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (IN/234), the IOM Gender Equality Policy 2015-2019 (C/106/INF/8/Rev.1), the IOM Data Protection Principles (IN/00138) and the IOM Reporting and Investigation of Misconduct Framework (IN/275).\n    ${ }^{8}$ The We Are All In reporting platform is a tool that sends confidential, encrypted reports on different types of misconduct and wrongdoings (including sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment) to the IOM Office of Internal Oversight (OIO).\n\nInformants confirmed that the development of the AAP Framework did not significantly involve Member States. The perspectives of Member States were not sufficiently explored for this evaluation to determine if alignment exists or not. However, IOM informants reported that a total of 225 affected persons, from different countries, participated in the consultation phase of the AAP Framework, prior to its piloting in 2018.\n\nIOM staff noted during interviews and in the survey that local communities may not always recognize the advantages of feedback mechanisms, or that there may be some cultural barriers to providing feedback. For example, one informant described how, in some contexts in Myanmar, giving negative feedback on assistance received may be avoided so as not to \"show lack of gratitude\". Staff attempt to convey that the assistance provided is an entitlement; however, obtaining open and candid feedback may be difficult in such contexts, meaning that any application (and assessment) of AAP needs an awareness of culturally appropriate approaches.\n\nFinding 1.2. AAP is deemed as having general relevance for IOM, although IN/285 is specific to emergency response contexts. ${ }^{9}$ The AAP team has effectively promoted the framework, but there is an unmet demand for translating theoretical guidelines into more practical tools and solutions. Exchange of practical experiences between various field offices.\n\nThe AAP Framework has a degree of specificity to humanitarian and emergency response operations. This was found to generate confusion about the operational scope of AAP, although AAP principles and approaches were felt to be relevant also for non-emergency contexts. Some informants suggested that the focus of the current AAP Framework could be revised to strengthen connections with the Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nA distinction should be drawn between the AAP Framework (IN/285) and other guidance and tools available for its \"operationalization\" (such as the IOM AAP toolkits on participation, (2020a), on information sharing and transparency (2020b), and on CFM (2020d)). Perceptions of the Framework often differed from perceptions of the guidance and tools. Most staff interviewed during KIIs found that the Framework was helpful for defining the role of AAP and its importance for the Organization. In contrast, only half of the respondents to the global survey (Figure 3) rated the usefulness of AAP guidance and tools as very high (17\\%) or high (29\\%). Informants often felt that, while IN/285 effectively frames AAP, the tools provided and guidance available for the actual implementation of AAP approaches were not as practical as they should be.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{9}$ It should be noted that, since 2024, AAP has gained formal relevance across all IOM programming as its oversight was shifted from the Department of Emergencies to the Protection Division. These developments took place during the evaluation period and could not be fully reflected in the findings, but they are relevant to their interpretation.\n\nFigure 3. Effectiveness of guidance and tools on accountability to affected populations for regional and local programming\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\nAI-generated image description:\n___\nHorizontal stacked bar chart showing survey responses about four aspects of AAP (Age-friendly Action Plan) implementation within IOM (International Organization for Migration). The chart displays percentage distributions across five response categories: 'I don't know' (dark red), 'Very high' (blue), 'High' (cyan), 'Moderate' (orange), 'Low' (green), and 'Very low' (yellow). The four measured aspects are: 1) Utility of IOM guidance on AAP to establish partnerships and implement joint programmes (highest response: 34% High), 2) Communication of AAP Framework and tools within IOM (highest response: 40% High), 3) Connection to cross-cutting issues of human rights, gender equality, disability, and environment (highest response: 30% High), and 4) Utility of AAP guidance and tools to help with programming at regional and local level (highest response: 33% High). Each bar shows the complete distribution of responses with percentages labeled. The chart indicates generally positive perceptions with 'High' and 'Moderate' responses being most common across all categories.\n___\n\nAt the time of this report, IOM had not yet established a dedicated results matrix or theory of change to serve as an all-encompassing system to set targets and track progress in implementing the AAP Framework within the Organization. However, AAP is included in the Organization's Strategic Plan 2024-2028, in the objectives and cross-cutting priorities of the accompanying SRF: ${ }^{10}$\n\n- Two AAP-related indicators are included in the cross-cutting priority \"integrity, transparency and accountability\":\n- C1.8: \"Number of IOM missions engaged in crisis-related programming integrating AAP into country strategic plans\";\n- C1.9: \"Number of IOM missions engaged in country's inter-agency AAP working group\".\n- One AAP-related indicator is included in the cross-cutting priority \"protection-centred approaches\":\n- C3.4: \"Percentage of projects integrating AAP operational pillars into their activities\".\n\nAAP is included as well within two of the three strategic objectives of IOM:\n\n- Objective 1. \"Saving lives and protecting people on the move\":\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ IOM (n.d.a). Note that detailed lists of the objectives and of the cross-cutting priorities can be accessed from this page via the \"Export\" option.\n\n- 1a1 (\"\\# and \\% of beneficiaries reporting that humanitarian assistance is delivered in a safe, accessible, accountable and participatory manner\");\n- 1b1a (\"\\# and \\% of new or revised migration-related policies or programming based on consultations with crisis-affected populations\");\n- 1b12a (\"\\# and \\% of crisis-affected persons, including members of community-based committees, who participated in decision-making for the design, planning and implementation of humanitarian programming\");\n- 1b12b (\"\\# of humanitarian programmes revised or designed to reflect consultations with the participation of crisis-affected populations\");\n- 1b23a (\"\\# and \\% of complaints processed in a timely, efficient and safe manner\");\n- 1b23b (\"\\% of projects that implement a complaint and feedback mechanism\");\n- 1b33a (\"\\# and \\% of beneficiaries who report sustained and meaningful participation in humanitarian protection interventions\");\n- 1c23a (\"\\# of humanitarian actors that have been supported to ensure that affected people and local actors are actively consulted in designing and implementing humanitarian response\");\n- 1c23b (\"\\# and \\% of beneficiaries who report being consulted in the design and implementation humanitarian response\").\n- Objective 3. \"Facilitating pathways for regular migration\":\n- 3d44a (\"\\# and \\% of beneficiaries reporting that assistance is delivered in a safe, accessible, accountable and participatory manner\").\n\nThe contrast between theoretical or legal frameworks and the availability of practical resources and support for their operationalization was a recurring theme in the narrative of many informants, especially in country offices. There was a desire expressed for SOPs, standard software applications for CFM management, solutions for the consolidation of AAP data from different sources, guidelines for AAP budget allocations, and guidance on how to engage with different stakeholders.\n\"While I've seen the Framework being useful within my field of expertise, more practical and standard tools are needed for day-to-day application. Additionally, developing standard indicators to monitor progress at both project and institutional level is essential.\"\n\nIOM staff.\n\nTraining provided by IOM Headquarters on IN/285 was appreciated, but there were also frequent calls for more detailed and technical follow-ups on the practical (\"how to\") aspects of AAP. As stated by one survey respondent, \"Guidance and tools should be much shorter and accessible to facilitate use for people who work extended hours and live under difficult conditions.\" Several informants stressed the importance of including concrete examples to illustrate practical AAP applications and benefits. These needs were already known by members of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters, and the creation of a more practical toolkit to fill some of the gaps was underway.\n\nThe AAP unit in IOM Headquarters effectively disseminated the AAP Framework and established a point of reference within the Organization, despite its relatively small size. Regular dissemination activities include the publication of newsletters, training offerings, and\n\nthe selection of pilot countries for exchanges of practices. However, this evaluation found that good practices in the field of AAP were not being identified and disseminated systematically. AAP activities and solutions remain, to a large extent, implemented in isolation, leading to missed opportunities to upscale or synergize with the initiatives of other projects, units or offices.\n\nFinding 1.3 The role of AAP in promoting cross-cutting themes is considered in the AAP Framework, with practical applications on the ground. The relevance of AAP for environmental sustainability is, however, not considered.\n\nThe IOM AAP Framework integrates diversity inclusion principles, focusing on vulnerable and marginalized groups, encompassing human rights, gender equality, and disability. IOM staff informants understood and highlighted the importance of AAP for promoting diversity inclusion. The framework specifies groups such as women, children, LGBTQIA+ individuals, the elderly, people with disabilities and ethnic and religious minorities, among others. During field visits in T\u00fcrkiye and Ethiopia, particular attention was found to be given to women and individuals with disabilities in different AAP initiatives. More generally, the data gathered suggest that IOM employs multiple mechanisms to engage vulnerable populations, offering guidance on reaching out to the most excluded and amplifying the voices of women, youth and other traditionally marginalized groups.\n\nNumerous instances were identified where women's specific needs were addressed and individuals with disabilities were included in focus group discussions and other consultation methods. However, environment-related inputs are not included in IN/285; further, AAP activities carried out in country offices that were observed or reviewed did not seem to consider the role of AAP in promoting environmental sustainability.\n\nFinding 1.4 The \"operational\" nature of IOM, and its direct interaction with affected people, give it a comparative advantage in the implementation of AAP initiatives. However, the contribution of IOM to AAP has limited visibility.\n\nConsidering that AAP is a responsibility of the humanitarian and development sector as a whole rather than of single or specific organizations, some evaluation questions asked respondents to explore how IOM contributes to the advancement of AAP from a sectorial and collective perspective. Having a \"local focus\" and being a \"frontline\" actor were the most frequently indicated comparative advantages of IOM.\n\nSeveral informants highlighted the potential of IOM to drive significant advancements in the AAP collective space and to foster \"collective accountability\". ${ }^{11}$ The Ethiopia case study (Case study 1) illustrates the work done by IOM in this country to provide a platform for the analysis and dissemination of AAP data shared by different actors. However, some informants\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{11}$ As noted in the IOM APP Framework (IOM, 2020c2), \"There is no commonly agreed-upon definition of collective accountability.\" However, as that document explains, the term is often used in the context of AAP discussions to indicate that \"multiple humanitarian actors are engaged in joint programming, provide common services and pursue collective outcomes\", and that therefore \"[a]ll actors involved in such joint efforts are required to ensure AAP obligations and commitments are upheld\". For more, see Finding 2.2 below. In the context of this evaluation, \"collective accountability\" broadly refers to how AAP should be undertaken jointly by different organizations present in a given operational context, to the extent they are all collectively accountable for their interventions (and the coordination between those interventions) among affected people.\n\nquestioned whether IOM was living up to its potential, arguing that more could be done to ensure AAP initiatives are coordinated with partners and made visible. These perceptions find confirmation from the desk review conducted for this evaluation, which identified only a relatively limited amount of public documentation and externally facing dissemination material on AAP initiatives led by IOM.\n\n### Coherence  ... page 21\n\nEvaluation questions and themes for the \"coherence\" criterion:\n\n- EQ7. Which mechanisms are in place to guarantee internal coherence for the inclusion of AAP principles and commitment in relevant IOM areas of work?\n- EQ8. Does IOM effectively align its AAP interventions with United Nations and IASC AAP related guidance and mechanisms at global, regional, and national levels?\n- EQ9. Are IOM AAP principles, mechanism and framework encouraging and reinforcing international and local partnerships for a comprehensive response tailored to the needs of affected populations?\n- EQ11. Have IOM AAP Framework initiatives been effective to foster coordination with local and international partners for a better response, tailored to the identified needs of the affected populations?\n\nFinding 2.1. IOM pursues AAP through various frameworks and initiatives that are not always coordinated.\n\nAt a general level, IOM is widely receptive to the integration of AAP principles and initiatives into its interventions. AAP-related initiatives were being pursued even before AAP was formalized in IN/285, though according to one informant, AAP was probably seen as \"good programming\" rather than a mandatory requirement.\n\nAccording to most informants, the idea of actively listening to and engaging with affected people is on the way to becoming fully accepted by IOM staff. This sentiment is exemplified by one chief of mission who stated that \"regular consultations are embedded in everything we do.\" This finding is supported by interviews with IOM regional and country offices, where the staff consulted reported frequent engagement with affected people before interventions, during programme implementation, in post-assessment surveys, and in community programmes to run local initiatives.\n\nAccording to many informants - and as also confirmed by the Turkish and Ethiopian case studies - collaboration on the implementation of AAP initiatives, as well as the search for synergies between different projects, units, or departments implementing AAP, appears to be challenging in IOM. Informants interviewed from various regions, particularly those in field offices, highlighted communication challenges within IOM departments and across different thematic initiatives. Despite increasing efforts to enhance connections between AAP and PSEAH, to enhance connections between AAP and the rights-based approach, and to enhance the gathering of AAP data by the DTM unit, difficulties persist. As one informant stated, \"IOM thoroughly engages with affected populations, but there is not unity between what is done by\n\nProtection, PSEAH, and AAP when interacting with vulnerable groups.\" Ultimately, many informants attributed these challenges to the \"projectized\" nature of IOM, where individual initiatives proceed in a more or less autonomous manner.\n\nInformants located in field offices also noted that different policies and thematic initiatives in IOM are, de facto, in competition with each other, as the resources and staff time available for their implementation may often be severely constrained. More or less deliberate trade-offs have to be made concerning different policies, noting also how support coming from IOM Headquarters is generally specific to a single initiative or theme, ignoring the interrelationships with other frameworks.\n\nA lack of coherence between AAP and the Data Protection Policy was mentioned by informants: obstacles to sharing AAP data (because such data include personal information) were noted in some cases, and a lack of support for the definition of data sharing agreements was noted in others. While the merit of these perceptions could not be verified as a technical analysis of the coherence between the AAP Framework and the Data Protection Policy goes beyond the scope of this evaluation, this instance is presented as an example of frameworks that may not have been fully coordinated in their development and in their implementation, for the further consideration of technical experts in IOM.\n\nFinding 2.2. There are instances where IOM promoted or supported collective accountability through its AAP initiatives, but there are also instances where coordination or collaboration with other actors was lacking. \"Collective accountability\" emerged as a central theme in the narrations of the informants and is an area where there may be an unmet demand for additional guidance, support and monitoring.\n\nIn Ethiopia, a joint platform exists where United Nations agencies and various organizations involved in the AAP working group can input data for shared use amidst the ongoing crisis. In this context, the IOM Ethiopia Chief of Mission provided direct reports to the United Nations Country Team on the feedback from affected people (see Case study 1). An additional significant case shared was the Response for Venezuela coordination platform, created by the Office of the Special Envoy for the Venezuela Response, with IOM acting as inter-agency AAP coordinator since 2021. According to IOM informants, the platform was crucial in orchestrating efforts across South America to assist Venezuelan migrants. In both examples, unified platforms were created for agencies to use AAP data collectively and conduct shared initiatives (such as AAP-related training courses), with perceived benefits to coherence and efficiency.\n\nAt the same time, informants also indicated the presence of significant obstacles and missed opportunities related to collaboration with other United Nations agencies and other organizations in terms of AAP. Almost all informants based in field locations that were consulted for this evaluation mentioned how, very often, feedback collected through CFMs cannot be fully acted upon by IOM alone, lamenting also the lack of a collective accountability approach by which different humanitarian and development actors could provide a coordinated and consolidated response to the issues raised. Informants noted that the fragmentation of AAP systems (across separate organizations) sometimes means that multiple\n\n(potentially unnecessary) consultations are conducted with affected people, causing fatigue and frustration, especially when complaints are only partially addressed (if at all). ${ }^{12}$\n\nSeveral informants indicated collective accountability as a focus area for investments aiming to refine AAP implementation. As part of the desk review conducted for this evaluation, no internal guidance nor technical resources regarding collective accountability (such as legal templates for collaboration or data sharing) were found. Moreover, it is worth noting how none of the SRF quantitative indicators that are currently in use to monitor AAP assess collective accountability.\n\n### Effectiveness  ... page 23\n\nEvaluation questions and themes for the \"effectiveness\" criterion:\n\n- EQ12. Are IOM's approaches and interventions adapting and responding effectively and timely to different aspects and rising needs of AAP?\n- EQ13. Has IOM's decision making been effective in leading, coordinating and delivering institutional AAP approach, to make the best use of IOM's strengths and areas of expertise?\n- EQ14. To what extent have IOM's AAP instruments, feedback mechanisms and broader community-based initiatives been effective to support the implementation of AAP principles and commitments for the most vulnerable and to ensure that no one is left behind?\n- EQ15. Have IOM's communication tools been effective to raise internal and external awareness on AAP and to properly integrate the views of affected populations?\n- EQ16. Are there systems in place to document and measure IOM's global and programmatic performance of the inclusion of AAP principles and commitments in its activities and to record lessons learned and factors affecting IOM's performance?\n\nFinding 3.1. There are clear indications that the overall volume of AAP activity is increasing in IOM, notably in terms of establishing CFMs and providing information to affected people. Yet the overall progress appears to be limited when considering the size of the Organization.\n\nAll performance indicators used by IOM to assess progress in AAP have improved (Table 3). The number of offices integrating AAP into the design, planning and implementation of responses, as well as the presence of focal points in inter-agency coordination, achieved values in 2023 that doubled the baseline of 2019. The integration of AAP in country-level crisis response plans also increased substantially. Interview and survey data gathered for this evaluation also indicate that IOM is making greater efforts to inform affected people and establish CFMs (both are pillars of the AAP Framework). ${ }^{13}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{12}$ As well, some informants associated conducting multiple consultations with the formation of unrealistic expectations among affected people.\n    ${ }^{13}$ As will be further elaborated in the subsection to follow on efficiency, qualitative findings also highlighted numerous operational challenges and difficulties in using the feedback gathered through CFMs.\n\nIn the absence of clear targets, the growth in volume of AAP activities can only be put in relation to the size of IOM as an Organization. As per the IOM website, the Organization operates in 171 countries globally and has 590 offices (IOM, n.d.b). From this viewpoint, results appear to be still a long way from achieving complete (or even extensive) coverage. Although the data from the indicators and the number of IOM offices indicated on the corporate website may not be directly comparable, doubts about whether the current progress should be considered satisfactory are legitimate.\n\nTable 3. Accountability to affected populations performance indicators used by IOM and available between 2019 and 2023\n\n|  Indicators available in the annual reports* | 2019 | 2020 | 2022 | 2023  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  Number of country-level crisis response plans that integrated AAP | 39 | 47 | N/A* | 47  |\n|  Number of offices engaged in crisisrelated responses with focal points participating in inter-agency coordination on AAP | 23 | 35 | 39 | 56  |\n|  Number of offices engaging with affected people in the design, planning, and implementation of responses | 61 | N/A* | 71 | 120  |\n\n- N/A: No data available for the relevant indicator in the annual report for the given year.\n\nSource: Data collected by AAP unit.\nFinding 3.2 Data gathered from affected people were seen to inform operational adjustments in several instances, but there is also a feeling that not all CFM data are used.\n\nThis evaluation revealed numerous instances where complaints and feedback led to programme adjustments. Programme changes cited included enhancing training sessions, offering more suitable shelters, revising procurement procedures to engage cost-effective services, integrating psychosocial support, installing additional lighting, designating a food distribution day for individuals with disabilities, identifying safer and more accessible locations for WASH facilities for women, improving ground insulation, transitioning from in-kind aid to cash-based interventions, promoting additional communal spaces, adjusting communication practices and cash delivery methods for households with special needs, addressing vulnerabilities, and enhancing the quality of food provided as well as refining beneficiary targeting and selection.\n\nIn the evaluation survey, respondents were asked to rate IOM competence in using feedback from affected people to modify programme implementation and enhance assistance: 43 per cent indicated a very high or high competence, 32 per cent gave a moderate rating, and 25 per cent rated it as low or very low. This varied perspective is supported by qualitative data: several of the IOM officers interviewed noted that considerable data are collected from affected people, but further efforts are needed to properly analyse and utilize it for informing implementation and future programme design. Others noted the lack of formal mechanisms\n\nfor follow-up adjustments, noting how these may not necessarily apply to an ongoing initiative but to future ones, and should therefore be considered at the project development phase.\n\nFigure 4. Assessment of IOM ability to use feedback from affected people to change programme implementation and better assist affected people\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\nAI-generated image description:\n___\nBar chart showing the distribution of program implementation levels and their effects on affected people. The chart displays five categories: 'Very high' (18%, blue bar), 'High' (25%, red bar), 'Medium' (32%, yellow/gold bar), 'Low' (18%, green bar), and 'Very low' (6%, orange bar). The y-axis shows percentages from 0% to 35%, and each bar is labeled with its corresponding percentage value. The 'Medium' category represents the largest proportion at 32%, while 'Very low' represents the smallest at 6%. The chart appears to be measuring the impact or reach of some program across different intensity levels.\n___\n\nSource: Evaluation survey.\n\nFinding 3.3. There is a perceived gap between the rationale for undertaking AAP and its practical implications for programming that, if filled, can increase effectiveness.\n\nIOM advocates internally for AAP through a human rights-based approach, consistent with its global principles and values. Nevertheless, most informants interviewed noted that the AAP Framework places limited emphasis on how programme implementation can practically benefit from the feedback received from affected people. As one of them stated, \"People have not realized the risk of not involving communities. It is crucial to show results [from involving affected people], not just principles. Explain to staff why they should do it.\"\n\nSeveral respondents suggested including more AAP-related material in the next revision of the IOM Project Handbook, to bridge the gap between policy and practice more effectively. It was suggested that such integration should explicitly integrate AAP activities into the project cycle. Moreover, some suggested making the link between AAP and risk management stronger: affected people are often better positioned than IOM to make practical decisions about programme activities (for example, selecting playground locations, determining suitable livelihood options in the local context and addressing educational access challenges) and even when not, their input on these decisions is anyway essential to avoid gross operational mistakes. In this sense, it was suggested that the involvement of affected people can be framed also as a vital tool for mitigating risks inherent in humanitarian and development interventions.\n\nFinding 3.4. The institutional framework for monitoring the implementation of AAP policy is basic and predominantly focuses on outputs rather than outcomes and impacts. The IOM SRF (2024) is commendable in that it shifts its focus towards outcomes, including service and programme satisfaction revised according to feedback from affected people, but there is still a need for a specific and comprehensive monitoring framework for AAP.\n\nThe monitoring of AAP in IOM is based on indicators included in other institutional monitoring tools rather than having its own dedicated logical framework based on a clear theory of change. The indicators used show that the focus of monitoring activities is predominantly on outputs, with targets not clearly defined and with an unclear distinction between outputs, outcomes and impacts, or objectives.\n\nIn the IOM Strategic Plan 2024-2028 and the IOM SRF, new AAP indicators have been included (see Annex C) that can enhance reflection on the tangible benefits of AAP. Concerning the identification of good practices, some informants in field offices expressed uncertainty on how \"success stories\" were identified by IOM Headquarters.\n\nFinding 3.5. Engagement with and awareness of AAP among senior or leadership officers is unequal, with officers in field offices being more committed to AAP than those in central functions.\n\nSeveral IOM officers consulted believed that senior leadership was somewhat disengaged from AAP or only marginally attentive to it. This sentiment is also reflected by the resources allocated to AAP activities at the central level, which several informants considered to be inadequate. ${ }^{14}$ The limited investment of core funding in AAP - with, at the time of this evaluation, the AAP Coordination Unit primarily being staffed by consultants funded by a specific USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance initiative - is perceived as a sign that implementing AAP is not a top priority for IOM.\n\nSenior staff consulted in field offices generally appeared to be engaged with and aware of AAP. In the IOM Ethiopia Country Office, for instance, AAP was addressed at the highest organizational level, enabling the appointment of AAP focal points for all suboffices, setting up mechanisms to share data with external partners, and holding discussions with the United Nations Country Team (see Case study 1). Conversely, the engagement of leadership at the headquarters level seemed to be confined to the initial stages, during the design and launch of the AAP Framework. This evaluation attempted to consult senior IOM Headquarters officers on this matter, but interviews did not take place due to the unavailability of the individuals contacted. ${ }^{15}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{14}$ This finding, gathered in 2024, backs up the 2023 MOPAN analysis regarding AAP, which concluded that IOM had not yet been able to consistently incorporate AAP across all its programmes and did not invest adequately in AAP, considering the scale of its operations.\n    ${ }^{15}$ The unavailability of senior IOM Headquarters staff to be interviewed for this evaluation was interpreted as a sign of limited engagement on the matter.\n\n### Efficiency  ... page 27\n\nEvaluation questions and themes for the \"efficiency\" criterion:\n\n- EQ10. What systems are in place to collect and integrate the views of affected populations in IOM's work?\n- EQ17. Are IOM's resource allocations appropriate to support IOM institutionalization and operationalization of AAP approach and related evolving international requirements? Are the specific resources allocated to AAP managed efficiently?\n- EQ18. Are the systems in place to support IOM offices in fundraising for AAP interventions efficient, adaptive, and cost-effective?\n- EQ20. Is IOM efficient in supporting and enhancing staff expertise and development in the field of AAP?\n\nFinding 4.1 The amount of resourcing allocated to AAP is inadequate to pursue institutional objectives, and the funding of AAP is not approached in strategic terms. The size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters increased but remained modest for the workload. ${ }^{10}$\n\nIOM was found to have implemented a large number of systems for collecting data from affected people. The decentralized structure of IOM was widely recognized by informants as conducive to tailoring AAP approaches to different operational and cultural contexts. Discussions of the diversity of tools used to engage affected people (including SMS, WhatsApp, social media, house visits, complaints boxes, hotlines, calls, surveys, focus group discussions and community engagement projects) emphasized the adaptability of IOM, particularly in challenging environments.\n\nAt the same time, informants interviewed for this evaluation overwhelmingly felt that the resources currently allocated to AAP in IOM Headquarters are insufficient to meet the demand for support and learning coming from country offices, as well as to drive the development or expansion of relevant guidance and resources. Some informants were frustrated by the absence of an overall funding strategy for AAP to support central AAP structures, noting how advancements often overly relied on the dedication of staffers instead of a structured and sustainable approach. At the country level, informants noted the way that funding for AAP functions often depends entirely on a single project-specific budget, with limited to no use of the (scarce) core resources available to country or regional offices, and rare cases of pooling resources proportionally from different projects (see Case study IOM Ethiopia for an example).\n\nThe size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters has expanded over time, though it clearly remains disproportionately small when considering the size of the Organization, as well as the fact that AAP is a mandatory aspect of the work of IOM since the formalization of the AAP Framework into IN/285. At the time of writing these findings, only one full-time staffer was\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{10}$ This finding should be read in conjunction with Finding 3.5.\n\ndedicated to AAP in IOM Headquarters, with the rest of the team consisting of five consultants (funded by the USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance based on a project agreement).\n\nFinding 4.2. Training and learning resources made available by the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters function to increase awareness of AAP and capacity, but there is still unmet demand for learning, especially when it comes to resources and support for bridging theory and practice.\n\nData collected for this evaluation clearly show that awareness and understanding of AAP concepts within IOM have increased since 2021. According to the evaluation survey, 56 per cent of respondents confirmed their awareness of AAP had grown since 2021, while 80 per cent reports very high to moderate improvement in their knowledge and technical capacity regarding APP over the same period (Figure 5).\n\nInformants generally recognized that this progress was, at least in part, due to the training initiatives led by the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters. Informants involved in the facilitation or design of these trainings perceived them as \"popular\" among IOM staff based on how the response of trainees and their participation was perceived (however, neither exact figures on attendance, nor pre-training and post-training assessments were reviewed as part of this evaluation). At the same time, several informants, especially those operating in country offices, mentioned that capacity gaps persisted and lamented an often \"superficial\" understanding of AAP principles and concepts among the \"average\" IOM staffer, due to lack of practical knowledge on how to implement AAP in actual operational settings and in a nonimprovisational manner. Informants interviewed for both the IOM T\u00fcrkiye and the IOM Ethiopia case studies provided similar remarks on a gap between understanding AAP and ability to implement it.\n\nFigure 5. Perceived growth of capacity and awareness of IOM staff since the launch of IN/285 in 2021\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\nAI-generated image description:\n___\nHorizontal stacked bar chart showing survey responses about AAP (Advance Approval Process) knowledge and awareness since the launch of IN/285 in 2021. The chart displays two questions with responses on a 5-point scale (Very low, Low, Moderate, High, Very high, plus 'I don't know'). For 'Increased technical knowledge and capacity concerning AAP since the launch of IN/285': 3% don't know, 27% very high, 23% high, 30% moderate, 16% low, 5% very low. For 'Increased awareness of AAP since the launch of IN/285': 12% don't know, 28% very high, 28% high, 27% moderate, 12% low, 6% very low. The chart uses color-coded bars (cyan, orange, green, yellow, red, blue) corresponding to each response category. The x-axis shows percentages from 0% to 35%. Source is listed as 'Evaluation survey'.\n___\n\nMany informants credited the dedication and proactivity of the small AAP team in IOM Headquarters in establishing learning mechanisms such as the AAP community of practice and the online repository, as well as in conducting global trainings. However, some informants felt that the demand for learning was still, to a significant extent, unmet. Most IOM staff interviewed valued the in-person AAP training sessions, feeling that these sessions helped them recognize the importance of integrating AAP into their programmes and daily practices. However, they also frequently expressed a need for more practical training and follow-up, sometimes indicating that conducting AAP training-of-trainers would be a possible solution.\n\nFigure 6. The perceived utility of the community of practice and the online repository\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\nAI-generated image description:\n___\nA grouped bar chart comparing three categories related to AAP (Accountability Action Plan) across six rating levels. The three categories are: 'Community of practice on AAP' (12% not available, 17% very high, 23% high, 18% moderate, 15% low, 16% very low), 'Online repository of AAP available for IOM Staff' (21% not available, 17% very high, 25% high, 22% moderate, 9% low, 7% very low), and 'Training provided by Headquarters on AAP to increase capacity in the area' (17% not available, 18% very high, 22% high, 19% moderate, 13% low, 10% very low). The chart uses six different colored bars (blue for 'Not available', red for 'Very high', yellow for 'High', green for 'Moderate', orange for 'Low', and cyan for 'Very low') to represent the distribution of responses. The y-axis shows percentages from 0% to 30%. Source is noted as 'Evaluation survey'.\n___\n\nSource: Evaluation survey.\nConcerning perceptions of the AAP community of practice and the online repository, survey data regarding the utility of these tools appear mixed, especially with regard to the community of practice (Figure 6), with some informants suggesting that more promotion and incentives for engagement would be needed to make the community more active and relevant.\n\nFinding 4.3. Guidance and resources are missing for efficient CFM development and management, leading to duplication of effort, reduced relevance and reduced impact of the analyses produced.\n\nThe lack of guidance and resources for CFM implementation and management (which could potentially range from simple form \"templates\" to dedicated software applications with multiple functions) was frequently mentioned by informants, especially those based in country offices. In particular, this gap was perceived as severely affecting efficiency, such as through loss of information or duplication of effort. The picture emerging from the different inputs on CFMs is one of fragmentation, where different systems and tools have been developed in\n\nrelative isolation, most often at the level of single projects, with rare instances where efforts were coordinated to devise solutions applicable to entire country offices. ${ }^{17}$\n\nThe predominant perception is that CFM development and management is an area of AAP that is particularly unstructured and lacking guidance, and one where significant duplication of effort may be taking place. Different examples of CFM systems of varying complexity and functions were gathered, always in the context of autonomous development. These narrations sometimes pointed at the significant upfront costs of setting up these systems, at how IOM may be incurring these costs multiple times across the different autonomous initiatives, and how these costs remain to date an insurmountable barrier for some smaller projects or country offices to set up \"modern\" solutions.\n\"IOM needs a systematic approach and structure for CFMs at field offices. Now there are separate, messy systems different across every [country office] and confusion on whether MEAL, Communications, or other function should manage them; confusion on how to use the feedback into and out of the country office and no systematic system to track followups.\"\n\nIOM staff.\n\nWhile flexibility and autonomy may promote innovation and better adaptation to different contexts, no informant elaborated on or suggested that a structured initiative is in place to map CFM solutions in the Organization, to identify scalable ones, or to identify and disseminate good practice in general. The development of a \"standard CFM system\" was sometimes mentioned as needed, although with some caveats and scepticism on the possibility of this solution being available in the short or medium term, with the suggestion that the Organization could look also at what other organizations have developed.\n\nAnother common theme in the responses concerning CFMs was the limited capacity to consolidate CFM data and produce analyses with uses that go beyond the reporting requirements of the specific project that funded the CFM. Most informants felt that data gathered through CFMs were not being fully utilized due to limited incentives or resources to go beyond the reporting requirements, which are very often based on simplistic indicators that merely count the number of complaints received and responded to, without looking at how those complaints are addressed. ${ }^{18}$\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{17}$ Case studies 1 and 2 provide some details on the CFM systems in use in IOM T\u00fcrkiye and IOM Ethiopia, and how their use may be limited to specific units or projects within the respective country offices. IOM Sudan was indicated by one informant as having developed a comprehensive CFM system, inclusive also of follow-up monitoring functionalities, although this solution could not be reviewed as part of this evaluation.\n    ${ }^{18}$ The points raised in this paragraph should be read in conjunction with Finding 2.2 on collective accountability.\n\n### Impact  ... page 31\n\nEvaluation questions and themes for the \"impact\" criterion: ${ }^{19}$\n\n- EQ21. How is IOM's impact in the field of AAP perceived by IOM Member States, donors, United Nations partners and affected populations, including beneficiaries?\n- EQ22. Did IOM's investments in AAP institutionalization and programmes lead to immediate and medium-term results and impacts that can be identified at global, regional, and national levels?\n- EQ23. Did IOM's programmes and projects have an impact on the representation and meaningful participation of particularly vulnerable population groups (i.e., women, girls, persons with disabilities) in decision making processes?\n\n\n#### Finding 5.1. While assessing impact is impossible at this stage, there are positive signs of increased involvement and engagement that might be attributable to AAP initiatives. ... page 31\n\nDuring the course of this evaluation, several examples were gathered of AAP being effectively implemented in different operational contexts. IOM piloted the AAP Framework in T\u00fcrkiye (see Case study 2), South Sudan and Nigeria. Noteworthy AAP practices have also been reported in Bangladesh (IOM, 2021c), Ethiopia (see Case study 1), Ukraine, the Response for Venezuela, Pakistan, Iraq and Somalia. In Ukraine, IOM developed several online consultation mechanisms to better reach mobile populations. In the Republic of Moldova, IOM has established a Telegram channel and has appointed a dedicated AAP officer to manage community engagements, trainings and hotlines, and to ensure the efficacy of the overall approach. ${ }^{20}$ In Ethiopia, a comprehensive AAP approach was developed, covering different functional and programmatic areas of the office. A common thread of the examples gathered was a strong leadership engagement, innovation and, in some cases, an expanded conception of AAP that included, for instance, actions to help increase the self-esteem of affected individuals (IOM, 2021c).\n\nExamples were also gathered of how engaging with affected people led to changes. In Ethiopia, it emerged that only men had access to short-term, unskilled or semi-skilled jobs (such as shelter maintenance, drainage system and water tanker installation) with partners in the camps: women within the committees advocated for equal job opportunities and this led to an increase in their participation in such roles. Also in Ethiopia, the design of shelters was modified based on women's needs and preferences. Discussions highlighted the significance of common shelters, preferred by women as offering a better sense of safety. Concerns regarding sanitation were also resolved through open dialogues in various sessions. Some\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{19}$ The authors acknowledge that impact assessment methodologies (featuring the use of a counterfactual and statistical techniques to robustly establish attribution) were outside of the scope of this evaluation. What is presented in this section should be taken as simply illustrative and preparatory to the definition of future impact assessments focusing on AAP activities, which the authors highly encourage IOM to undertake.\n    ${ }^{20}$ IOM Moldova Telegram channel. According to the IOM situation report from Moldova for October-December 2023, \"IOM continues to mainstream AAP through online information sessions, a toll-free call centre and community information centres, offering comprehensive information on IOM project activities, available support and acting as a platform for receiving complaints, feedback, and referrals. In November [2023], an information session hosted on IOM Moldova's Telegram channel, with over 1,000 members, addressed 39 questions about IOM's assistance. The toll-free call centre at 080010877 continues to serve as the primary channel for referrals, feedback, and complaints. Throughout the reporting period, a total of 1,433 calls were received, with most inquiries focusing on rental assistance, cash assistance, and legal support\" (IOM, 2023e:6).\n\ninformants suggested that, with regard to IOM distribution activities, consultations on distribution reach, quality and procedures with the affected people improved the integrity of the distribution process. These informants indicated that such AAP initiatives were taking place in IOM T\u00fcrkiye.\n\nThe notion that AAP can lead to improvements in programme design and implementation, as well as to improved outcomes, was understood by most individuals consulted. Numerous examples were provided of past or ongoing initiatives to involve affected people in the project cycle, with a strong emphasis on the inclusion of women and people with disabilities. However, it was not always clear whether these initiatives necessarily translated into significant changes; nor was it clear that it fostered a sense of agency and empowerment among the individuals and communities involved. ${ }^{21}$\n\nAt the field level, the evaluators came across initiatives supporting self-governance structures and participation in camp activities. Beneficiaries were encouraged to take on tasks related to on-site management and daily routines, and to running relatively small-scale projects. These initiatives were deemed as promising and relevant for enhancing the impact of AAP.\n\n### Sustainability  ... page 32\n\nEvaluation questions and themes for the \"sustainability\" criterion:\n\n- EQ19. Does IOM's participation in the United Nations and IASC mechanisms facilitate access to funding and resource mobilization related to AAP?\n- EQ24. What systems are in place to address and guarantee the sustainability of IOM's application of AAP principles and commitments in its interventions?\n- EQ25. Does IOM's engagement with governments, civil society, the United Nations, IASC and affected populations facilitate the sustainability of IOM's support and accountability?\n- EQ26. Has IOM's integration of AAP principles in its work helped to generate stable and long-lasting participation and accountability mechanisms for people from affected marginalized groups?\n\nFinding 6.1: IN/285 constitutes a milestone achievement for sustainability, as it provides a legal basis for the IOM commitment to AAP. However, uneven leadership engagement and inadequate resourcing risk making this commitment aspirational rather than real.\n\nAs part of the Grand Bargain and other international commitments, IOM operates within a broader network of United Nations organizations and donors advocating for investment in AAP. Informants saw that active engagement in this environment was key to receiving dedicated funding for the development of the IOM AAP Framework. ${ }^{22}$ The release of IN/285\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{21}$ Some results from the global survey also suggested less than clear outcomes in this area. When staff were asked if IOM activities had successfully enhanced the participation of vulnerable populations in decision-making processes and whether they had resulted in improved well-being and empowerment, results were mixed. See Annex E for the full details on the survey results.\n    ${ }^{22}$ IOM has received substantial and dedicated donor support for the development of its AAP Framework, particularly from the United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and the USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance. Informants also acknowledged the benefits gained from engagement with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) while developing the institutional AAP Framework.\n\n(alongside all the related initiatives led by a small but dedicated AAP unit in IOM Headquarters) marked a fundamental institutional milestone for the sustainability of AAP in IOM, as it established AAP integration as mandatory within the Organization, and gave a legal foundation for the IOM commitment to AAP.\n\nAt the same time, this evaluation found that the level of understanding of and support for AAP among senior and leadership officers was unequal (Finding 3.5) and generally insufficient at the central level. ${ }^{23}$ It found that resources for central AAP functions are inadequate, that the AAP unit is undersized vis-\u00e0-vis the tasks at hand, and that funding for AAP at the country level largely depends on single projects (Finding 4.1). This has resulted in a fragmented approach and in the whole AAP agenda being driven by initiatives often undertaken in relative isolation, sometimes unable to respond to broader AAP needs that go beyond those of the single funding project. Inefficiencies - with cost implications, as in the case of CFM development and management (Finding 4.3) - are also relevant to the longer-term sustainability of AAP, given the context of inadequate resources.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{23}$ The fact that the development of the AAP Framework was funded through project resources, and that central AAP functions depended, at the time of this evaluation, largely on project funding rather than core resources, may support this view.\n## 3. CONCLUSIONS  ... page 34\n\nThe 2023 MOPAN assessment of IOM concluded that, with regard to AAP, IOM has not yet been able to consistently incorporate AAP across all its programmes, and did not invest adequately in AAP, considering the scale of its operations. ${ }^{24}$ Overall, this evaluation confirms these MOPAN conclusions. As well, it identifies areas where considerable progress has been made or is being made, mainly thanks to the dedication of an undersized central AAP unit, and that of several staffers in country offices who most often undertake AAP initiatives with project-specific funding.\n\nThe IOM AAP Framework is relevant to the mission of the Organization and consistent with the United Nations system and with IASC policies. The desk review and consultations held confirmed that the IOM AAP approach considers the cross-cutting issues of human rights, gender equality and disability, though it does not address environmental issues well (or at all). IN/285 was developed in consultation with various stakeholders and through a thorough review of previous organizational frameworks to ensure internal consistency. As a result, IN/285 is formally consistent with other relevant IOM policies and guidelines. However, at the operational level, where field staff have to consider multiple policies and organizational priorities, the interlinkages between AAP and other frameworks (such as data protection, for example) are not always explicitly addressed, due to a perceived lack of available guidance, tools and support that address such links. To extend the example of data protection, the practical resources (such as a template for data-sharing agreements) and support are lacking that would be required to ensure that AAP activities oriented towards collective accountability (which sometimes entail sharing the personal data of affected persons, for instance) are undertaken in accordance with data protection principles and standards.\n\nThe provision of appropriate guidance and tools for practical AAP implementation is an essential aspect that this evaluation considered. Informants overwhelmingly found that IN/285 was valuable in steering IOM efforts in AAP and appreciated the training sessions offered by IOM Headquarters to improve awareness of these requirements (IN/285 established the mandatory nature of AAP in IOM). At the same time, some informants voiced doubts about the practical implications of the mandatory nature of AAP, and about whether IN/285 applied to non-emergency response operations (since IN/285 does indeed focus on emergency response operations). Overall, the data gathered are clear in indicating that there is an unmet demand for learning, for a clearer integration of AAP into the IOM project cycle, for more \"standard\" tools (especially in the area of CFM) and for closer support in implementing AAP activities, as these take place in diverse and sometimes challenging operational contexts that might require tailor-made solutions. It is also clear from the desk review conducted for this evaluation that AAP activities have very limited internal and external visibility, ultimately both affecting the perception of their relevance and limiting awareness of them.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{24}$ MOPAN (2023): \"the assessment found that AAP is still only partially integrated into country strategies, programme designs and partnership agreements, and reporting on AAP activities is not systematic... Given the complexity of IOM's operations, there is still some way to go to institutionalise AAP across the organisation\" (47).\n\nThe notion of \"accountability\" in AAP should always be seen as collective, in the sense that the whole humanitarian and development system should be accountable to the affected people they are supposed to serve, rather than each single organization holding that accountability individually. All actors operating in a specific context should work in concert to achieve common goals and complement each other, based on their respective roles and capabilities, and that requires collective accountability. ${ }^{25}$ In this evaluation, collective accountability emerged as a frequent and important concept in the narration of many informants. Instances were described in which IOM established effective communication and coordination with other United Nations agencies and partners (for example, for the joint collection, analysis and dissemination of CFM or needs data) to promote collective accountability. In other cases, scenarios of limited inter-agency communication and collaboration on AAP were described, sometimes producing cumbersome or uncertain referrals, and sometimes making it impossible to properly address reasonable needs voiced by affected people, as these did not fall within the IOM operational sphere.\n\nMany examples of operational changes and adaptations that were based on feedback received from affected people were gathered as part of this evaluation, suggesting that AAP initiatives have some effectiveness in informing operations. At the same time, some findings point at the need to structure or strengthen the processes that translate feedback into meaningful operational adjustments (in a timely manner), and several informants perceived that not all data gathered from affected people were being used.\n\nAt an aggregate level, more and more AAP engagement is taking place in IOM, as confirmed by both the prevalent perceptions of informants and by the fact that indicators used to monitor AAP in IOM are generally recording substantial improvements. It is, however, doubtful whether the current level of AAP engagement is commensurate to the size of IOM operations. Moreover, IOM does not have a formal result matrix or a theory of change for AAP; rather, it relies on a collection of indicators from different institutional monitoring frameworks, mostly focusing on outputs and on broadly defined outcomes, which makes it hard to usefully assess the implementation of AAP. Overall progress still seems insufficient to support claims of AAP mainstreaming within the Organization.\n\nThe opinion that resources allocated to AAP in IOM are inadequate was prevalent in both qualitative and quantitative data gathered for this evaluation. The work that led to IN/285 was funded by donors on the basis of a specific initiative. The size of the central AAP unit in IOM Headquarters was generally deemed insufficient to proactively engage with technical support, capacity-building activities including training and programme and policy development. In country offices, AAP initiatives are most often funded by and within specific projects, with their scope tailored to the requirements of the funding initiative. Some informants doubted that IOM has a strategic approach to the funding of AAP, neither at the central nor at the country\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{25}$ Some informants pointed out the fact that collective accountability applies not only to the organizations intervening in a certain operational context, but also to their donors. According to one informant, donors sometimes push for the integration of AAP into the initiatives they fund, but then are not necessarily equipped or willing to make adjustments to their funding allocations when these would be required to follow-up on feedback received from affected people. The role of donors was not sufficiently explored in this evaluation to formulate specific findings and recommendations on this issue. It is, however, hoped that this aspect will be explored in future evaluative work.\n\nlevel, where only one office (Ethiopia; see Case study 1) was known to have devised a system by which AAP activities are undertaken through an office-wide approach (rather than being project specific) and funded proportionally by all relevant projects.\n\nThe scarcity of resources allocated to AAP might have created strong incentives for their efficient utilization, especially at the central level. However, some findings point at how the \"fragmented\" funding approach based on individual projects (and the uncertainties that come with that) may be creating inefficiencies, especially in terms of duplication when developing and managing CFMs (a domain of AAP on which an urgent need for institutional guidance and resources was often voiced). These narratives stress the importance of greater communication and collaboration on AAP between different projects, technical areas and implementing units, establishing wherever there are possible office-wide approaches to AAP.\n\nAssessing the impact of AAP initiatives goes beyond the scope of this evaluation and its methodological design. It is, however, hoped that these findings might help identify cases that can be the subject of robust impact assessments in the future.\n\nThe release of IN/285 was a milestone achievement for IOM engagement with AAP. By providing a legal foundation for the IOM commitment to AAP, this document is one of the pillars for the sustainability of IOM AAP engagement. Active participation in the IASC on AAP was largely perceived to have brought benefits in terms of resource mobilization and awareness, leading to the conclusion that this engagement should not dwindle. Moreover, there are clear signs that AAP principles and values are penetrating IOM \"corporate culture\", with more and more staff understanding the need for and advantages of accountability, including important aspects of it such as meaningful community engagement and robust CFMs. Conversely, uneven support for AAP among the senior management of the Organization (with a gap noted in IOM Headquarters leadership), the inadequate resources allocated to AAP, as well as the absence of a clear strategic approach to AAP funding and implementation (at both central and country office levels), all cast a shadow over the sustainability of AAP, with the risk of increasing perceptions that IOM commitments on this matter remain more aspirational than real.\n## 4. RECOMMENDATIONS  ... page 37\n\nIOM should be mindful of the fact that the following recommendations and their recommended actions may have to be implemented in a specific order to optimize benefits. The way these have been ordered here is not suggesting an \"optimal\" implementation sequence. Finding the optimal implementation sequence is something that IOM will have to undertake in the context of the development of a comprehensive strategy and related action plan for AAP (Recommendation 2).\n\nSome recommendations embed activities that can be considered by IOM for follow-up. Any management response given to these recommendations should elaborate on the merit of the proposed activities, making sure that a robust justification is provided when any activity is discarded.\n\nRecommendation 1: The AAP team should clarify that the scope and applicability of AAP extends beyond emergency response operations, reinforcing also the message on the mandatory nature of $\\mathrm{IN} / 285$.\n\nThis recommendation responds to findings suggesting that doubts persist regarding the mandatory nature of $\\mathrm{IN} / 285$ and its applicability beyond emergency response operations, considering that the instruction focuses specifically on this type of intervention. To this end, a revision of the instruction or the release of other types of official statements specifically addressing these doubts should be considered.\n\nRecommendation 2: The AAP team should develop an operational medium- to longer-term strategy for AAP, to be negotiated at the highest leadership level, with a three-year plan connected to a funding strategy.\n\nThis recommendation considers findings on the uneven support for AAP among IOM senior management, placing emphasis on the need to have the strategy endorsed at the level of deputy director generals, or even directly by the Director General. The resulting strategy should also be usable as a fundraising tool to attract more resources towards AAP, while also mobilizing core funding to show the Organization's institutional commitment to AAP.\n\nRecommendation 3: In conjunction with Recommendation 2 above, the AAP team should develop a theory of change and a dedicated monitoring and evaluation framework for AAP.\n\nA more structured strategic approach to AAP will require a dedicated and robust framework for its effective monitoring. A new dedicated framework can build from the current existing framework but will need to feature additional indicators (formulated also on the basis of the findings of this evaluation) and, where necessary, improve the formulation of some of the existing outcome indicators.\n\nThe new framework must not be limited to monitoring, but must also include an evaluation plan that can, at a minimum, include reviews or evaluations at regular intervals, or evaluative exercises focused on specific aspects of AAP or initiatives, considering also impact assessments.\n\nRecommendation 4: The senior management and the Protection Division should strengthen central AAP functions, ensuring that the size of the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters becomes adequate for meeting AAP strategic objectives and that there is capacity to proactively support country offices in structuring their approach to AAP implementation.\n\nFor the follow-up to this recommendation, the following activity should be considered:\n\n- Increase staff resources in regional offices, establishing AAP-dedicated positions or designating focal persons with both technical knowledge and time capacity, ${ }^{26}$ ensuring these have a clear mandate to undertake AAP tasks effectively and efficiently, and that technical reporting lines to AAP officers in IOM Headquarters are established.\n\nRecommendation 5: The AAP team should support country offices in developing office-wide approaches to AAP implementation and funding, reducing fragmentation.\n\nThis recommendation should be based on known cases of office-wide approaches to AAP, such as IOM Ethiopia (Case study 1), where AAP functions are centralized in a specific unit, a network of AAP focal persons has been established, and funding for AAP activities is regularly included in and taken from different initiatives proportional to their budget.\n\nCentral AAP functions should establish minimum standards for operating AAP at the country level and should provide different models for the funding and centralization of AAP functions, taking into account different country office sizes, specializations and operational contexts.\n\nFor the follow-up to this recommendation, the following activities should be considered:\n\n- Develop specific guidance on AAP system development in country offices, including funding methodologies.\n- Establish a fund for supporting select country offices to cover the start-up costs of integrated, office-wide AAP systems. Select recipients of support through open competition\n\nRecommendation 6: The Protection Division and the AAP team should increase the visibility of AAP activities, both internally and externally, on the basis of a clear visibility and knowledge management plan.\n\nThe desk review of AAP documentation clearly indicated that an insufficient amount of \"visibility\" material, including case studies and AAP best practice documentation, has been produced to document AAP activities and their influence on the work of IOM.\n\nIt is key that efforts on AAP visibility are formalized in a dedicated plan, formulated by the AAP central unit in coordination with communication specialists, and that country offices are provided with guidance, tools and support on AAP best practices around documentation and visibility.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{26}$ Focal persons are intended to be staffers not fully dedicated to working on AAP, but rather staffers who have AAP responsibilities alongside other responsibilities.\n\nIncreasing the visibility of AAP activities should not be limited to producing dedicated material; as well, general communications on IOM interventions should highlight their AAP components and results.\n\nFor the follow-up to this recommendation, the following activities should be considered:\n\n- Conduct a comprehensive mapping of AAP activities and approaches, on which the identification of good practices can be based.\n- Establish regular dissemination channels on AAP (such as newsletters, blogs and webinar series), with the specific intent of giving visibility to good practice and innovative initiatives.\n- Promote the publication and dissemination of case studies on AAP, building on communities of practice and collaboration with other thematic and programme areas.\n- Use communications to strengthen incentives for engagement in AAP, including prizes given to best initiatives, solutions and achievements.\n- Strengthen current knowledge management practice in AAP.\n\nRecommendation 7: The AAP team should increase training opportunities and update capacitybuilding material with increased focus on practical AAP implementation and including standard tools and templates, which will have been developed in consultation with relevant field offices, partners and community of practice members.\n\nInformants overwhelmingly indicated that more practical guidance on AAP is needed. Such guidance could include standard CFM SOPs, template feedback forms, off-the-shelf CFM management systems and CFM data analysis dashboards, all of which should be easily adapted to and deployed in field contexts. Training material and capacity-building resources should also be expanded accordingly and should place renewed focus on practical AAP implementation. The training supply should also be expanded, as demand is currently not fully met.\n\nFor the follow-up to this recommendation, the following activities should be considered:\n\n- Develop practical guidance material (such as a template and guidance for AAP datasharing agreements, CFM forms, etc.) based on the requests of field-level AAP focal persons and involving the AAP community of practice.\n- Critically review current training methodology and identify ways in which training effectiveness can be enhanced, and in which the notions acquired can be put to practical use. This may include on-the-job training arrangements, training follow-ups, and peer review and engagement.\n- Include AAP-related material in the current revision of the IOM Project Handbook to bridge the gap between policy and practice.\n- Develop and conduct an AAP training-of-trainer initiative.\n\nRecommendation 8: The AAP team should enhance and standardize CFM systems used in IOM through the following actions:\n\n- Map existing CFM systems.\n\n- Conduct a comprehensive assessment of all CFM systems currently in use within IOM.\n- Identify overlaps, gaps and areas for improvement in existing mechanisms.\n- Establish minimum standards and ensure compliance.\n- Define clear minimum standards for CFM systems to ensure consistency, efficiency and accessibility.\n- Implement measures to ensure that all mapped CFMs align with these standards.\n- Develop and disseminate CFM-specific materials.\n- Create guidance documents, training materials and communication resources to support the effective implementation of CFMs.\n- Ensure dissemination across all relevant teams and offices.\n- Move towards standardization and integration.\n- Work towards harmonizing CFM systems across IOM to ensure uniformity in processes and reporting.\n- Facilitate the integration of CFMs into broader corporate systems for streamlined data collection and analysis.\nThis recommendation relates to the many findings regarding CFMs in this evaluation, and in particular to how CFM development and management processes are being undertaken in autonomy by different offices or departments within IOM, resulting in duplication of effort and missed opportunities for efficiency and synergy. Central AAP functions are therefore recommended to control and regulate CFM-related processes and outputs more actively.\n\nNew guidance on developing and managing CFMs should cover both technological and organizational aspects, with the former focusing on minimum standards and compliance, and the latter promoting the development of office-wide CFM systems with clear processes, roles and responsibilities for the various functions available in the office.\n\nNoting also how CFM development has happened outside of institutional system development and management processes, after having established minimum standards, in particular on data protection, cybersecurity and data utilization (as the prevalent perception of informants was that not all CFM data are analysed and used), IOM should move towards the institutionalization of the more promising CFM systems available within IOM and beyond, possibly through a transparent, open selection process.\n\nRecommendation 9: IOM more broadly, and the AAP team more specifically, should continue the collaboration and engagement on collective accountability, actively participating in coordination structures on AAP, such as IASC-promoted initiatives or initiatives developed in other inter-agency coordination spaces, both at the global and country level.\n\nTo follow up this specific recommendation, the following activities should be implemented:\n\n- Disseminate best practices on collective accountability and inter-agency coordination, including on the implementation of joint projects such as inter-agency CFMs or other similar initiatives, and conduct specific training courses on this matter.\n\n- Ensure AAP focal points or dedicated staff have formalized inter-agency tasks in their job descriptions and their terms of reference, and that AAP coordination is part of the overall objectives of designated AAP roles.\n- Include AAP resources (staff capacity and funding) to allow for active IOM participation in inter-agency spaces, including co-leading AAP working groups and taskforces when relevant.\n- Include collective AAP contributions as a key metric of a revised theory of change and monitoring framework for AAP (linked to Recommendation 3).\n- Disseminate the IOM-led inter-agency leadership training on AAP to all IOM senior management.\n- Showcase successful experiences of collective accountability within IOM (for example, Ethiopia and Response for Venezuela).\n### Evaluation Context ... page 9\n\nIOM follows the IASC definition of AAP, which describes it as \"an active commitment to use power responsibly by taking account of, giving account to, and being held to account by the people humanitarian organisations seek to assist\" (IASC, 2015). Since the 1990s, the AAP agenda has significantly expanded within the humanitarian response field. It has evolved through the humanitarian reform process that followed the IASC Humanitarian response review (2005), the IASC Transformative Agenda (2011), the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) (2016) and the IASC Grand Bargain platform (2016). These changes have all contributed to emphasizing the needs, perspectives and rights of affected people rather than viewing them as merely the passive recipients of assistance.\n\nIn 2020, IOM introduced the AAP Framework, which became a mandatory instruction (IN/285) in 2021. This framework was created following guidance from IASC. Furthermore, activities related to AAP were tracked in several pilot countries over three years to help define the framework and monitor the implementation. T\u00fcrkiye was one of these pilot countries.\n\nWithin the IOM organizational framework, the responsibility for AAP initially fell to the Department of Operations and Emergencies, which was recently restructured into the Department of Humanitarian Response and Recovery (DHRR). This department was assigned the first global coordination focal point. In 2024, by decision of the IOM Director General, responsibility for AAP was transferred to the Protection Division. At the time of writing this background, the AAP Coordination Unit, comprising four team members, operated within the Protection Division.\n\nAs outlined in the AAP Framework, \"IOM's foundation for action on AAP is firmly rooted in several key IOM strategic documents.... The AAP Framework brings these provisions together for a consolidated institutional approach\" (IOM, 2020c:6). These key strategic documents include the Migration Crisis Operational Framework (MC/2355), the Humanitarian Policy (C/106/CRP/20) and the Gender Equality Policy (C/106/INF/8/REV.1). ${ }^{2}$ The obligatory aspect of the AAP Framework means that all forthcoming policies and guidelines \"must adequately represent and take the IOM AAP Framework into account\" (IOM, 2020c:6). The AAP Framework outlines five objectives aimed at enhancing the IOM approach to AAP and integrating it into IOM actions. These objectives focus on leadership; information-sharing and transparency; participation; complaints and feedback mechanisms; and partner coordination. The AAP Coordination Unit is tasked with promoting and overseeing AAP activities within the Organization, as well as representing IOM in pertinent AAP forums. Their activities include\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{2}$ Other documents include the Standards of Conduct (IN/15, REV. 1), the Policy and Procedures for Preventing and Responding to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (IN/234), the IOM Data Protection Principles (IN/00138), the guidance note on how to mainstream protection across IOM crisis response (IN/232), and the IOM Reporting and Investigation of Misconduct Framework (IN/275).\n\ndeveloping normative guidance, creating toolkits, conducting training sessions, providing technical support, disseminating information, managing knowledge and establishing an internal AAP community of practice.\n\nThe AAP Coordination Unit is tasked with monitoring AAP implementation within IOM. It coordinates data collection and consolidation for the assessment of these indicators. Informants from within the unit stated that qualitative data collection was also being carried out to complement these quantitative indicators. The quantitative and qualitative data collected were analysed and presented against a definition of the four main areas of activity related to AAP: to provide information to affected people; to encourage and enhance participation from affected people; to establish and use feedback mechanisms to improve programming; and to participate in inter-agency AAP coordination spaces.\n\nAssessing progress and impact in the realm of AAP is inherently complex due to the crosssectional nature of the AAP Framework; this is a challenge encountered not solely by IOM but also across the broader humanitarian sector. To tackle this issue, IASC has established a working group tasked with developing standard indicators for AAP in humanitarian contexts. ${ }^{3}$\n### Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope  ... page 10\n\nIOM, through CED, decided to carry out a strategic and thorough evaluation of its efforts and accomplishments in the area of AAP. This evaluation is part of the CED 2023-2024 Biennial evaluation workplan, and is considered an aspect of a larger institutional initiative to ensure that AAP commitments are fulfilled. The aim of this evaluation was to provide recommendations for actions at various levels, based on a general review of AAP within IOM.\n\nIn particular, the evaluation concentrated on:\n\n- IOM global engagement with AAP in both emergency and non-emergency situations, covering policies, strategies and programmatic methods established since 2016 (that is, before the launch of the AAP Framework).\n- Best practices and opportunities for improvement regarding IOM decision-making, policy formulation, technical guidance and programme execution for a holistic and cooperative AAP approach, as well as to ensure external alignment with United Nations agencies, other organizations and governments.\n- The progress on implementing the 2019 MOPAN recommendations related to AAP and IASC commitments, especially in light of the 2023 MOPAN review of IOM.\n- Field-based examination of IOM contributions to regional and national projects and community-based approaches to AAP.\n- Activities conducted within the IASC task force and other groups.\n- The comparative advantage of IOM in system-wide, strategic solutions and responses, and how sustainability can be further improved.\n\n[^0]\n[^0]:    ${ }^{3}$ As reported during interviews in the inception phase.\n\nThe evaluation did not focus on the implementation of AAP within specific projects. Instead, it examined AAP activities worldwide based on aggregated data from national, regional and global levels.\n\nThe intended audience for this evaluation includes IOM management, IOM staff engaged in implementing the AAP approach at Headquarters and in the field, interested donors, Member States and both international and local partners.\n\nThe evaluation employed the six standard criteria of the OECD Development Assistance Committee: relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability (OECD, 2024). It also incorporated an analysis of the cross-cutting themes of gender, disability, environment and human rights-based approaches, as they intersected with AAP within IOM.
