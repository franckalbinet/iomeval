In the absence of clear targets, the growth in volume of AAP activities can only be put in relation to the size of IOM as an Organization. As per the IOM website, the Organization operates in 171 countries globally and has 590 offices (IOM, n.d.b). From this viewpoint, results appear to be still a long way from achieving complete (or even extensive) coverage. Although the data from the indicators and the number of IOM offices indicated on the corporate website may not be directly comparable, doubts about whether the current progress should be considered satisfactory are legitimate.

Finding 3.2 Data gathered from affected people were seen to inform operational adjustments in several instances, but there is also a feeling that not all CFM data are used.

This evaluation revealed numerous instances where complaints and feedback led to programme adjustments. Programme changes cited included enhancing training sessions, offering more suitable shelters, revising procurement procedures to engage cost-effective services, integrating psychosocial support, installing additional lighting, designating a food distribution day for individuals with disabilities, identifying safer and more accessible locations for WASH facilities for women, improving ground insulation, transitioning from in-kind aid to cash-based interventions, promoting additional communal spaces, adjusting communication practices and cash delivery methods for households with special needs, addressing vulnerabilities, and enhancing the quality of food provided as well as refining beneficiary targeting and selection.

In the evaluation survey, respondents were asked to rate IOM competence in using feedback from affected people to modify programme implementation and enhance assistance: 43 per cent indicated a very high or high competence, 32 per cent gave a moderate rating, and 25 per cent rated it as low or very low. This varied perspective is supported by qualitative data: several of the IOM officers interviewed noted that considerable data are collected from affected people, but further efforts are needed to properly analyse and utilize it for informing implementation and future programme design. Others noted the lack of formal mechanisms
