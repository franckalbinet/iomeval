#### Case Studies  ... page 13

Two case studies were conducted as part of the evaluation to provide practical examples from the field regarding the implementation of the AAP Framework. The IOM country offices selected for these case studies were Ethiopia and Türkiye, based on specific criteria. The IOM presence in Ethiopia is one of its largest, including a country office in Addis Ababa, 14 field offices, as well as Migration Response Centres, migration health assessment clinics and transit centres. It has a highly articulated operational and political setup, encompassing both crisis and non-crisis situations. Within IOM, IOM Ethiopia is considered as having a significant or even comprehensive AAP portfolio. IOM Türkiye was selected because Türkiye was one of the "pilot countries" in which the AAP Framework was initially tested. Additionally, IOM Türkiye makes an interesting case because it applied AAP approaches to cross-border operations with Syria in ways that were seen as innovative.

The analysis of the case studies followed the same evaluation criteria as the overall exercise. Interview guides for the case studies were adapted from those used in interviews with IOM staff in other regions, to maintain consistency in the investigation of the primary themes. Data collected regarding the case studies were qualitative, obtained through observations, interviews and focus group discussions. These case studies aimed not to generalize experiences but to identify effective and ineffective practices, understand how information was being communicated from IOM Headquarters, and map out lessons learned. The two case studies were valuable because the experiences of those involved in them were in some ways different and in others similar, adding depth and specificity to the global findings. They effectively illustrated the results gathered from global surveys and interviews with IOM staff at various levels (national, regional and global).
