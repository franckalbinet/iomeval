(potentially unnecessary) consultations are conducted with affected people, causing fatigue and frustration, especially when complaints are only partially addressed (if at all). ${ }^{12}$

Several informants indicated collective accountability as a focus area for investments aiming to refine AAP implementation. As part of the desk review conducted for this evaluation, no internal guidance nor technical resources regarding collective accountability (such as legal templates for collaboration or data sharing) were found. Moreover, it is worth noting how none of the SRF quantitative indicators that are currently in use to monitor AAP assess collective accountability.

### Effectiveness  ... page 23

Evaluation questions and themes for the "effectiveness" criterion:

- EQ12. Are IOM's approaches and interventions adapting and responding effectively and timely to different aspects and rising needs of AAP?
- EQ13. Has IOM's decision making been effective in leading, coordinating and delivering institutional AAP approach, to make the best use of IOM's strengths and areas of expertise?
- EQ14. To what extent have IOM's AAP instruments, feedback mechanisms and broader community-based initiatives been effective to support the implementation of AAP principles and commitments for the most vulnerable and to ensure that no one is left behind?
- EQ15. Have IOM's communication tools been effective to raise internal and external awareness on AAP and to properly integrate the views of affected populations?
- EQ16. Are there systems in place to document and measure IOM's global and programmatic performance of the inclusion of AAP principles and commitments in its activities and to record lessons learned and factors affecting IOM's performance?

Finding 3.1. There are clear indications that the overall volume of AAP activity is increasing in IOM, notably in terms of establishing CFMs and providing information to affected people. Yet the overall progress appears to be limited when considering the size of the Organization.

All performance indicators used by IOM to assess progress in AAP have improved (Table 3). The number of offices integrating AAP into the design, planning and implementation of responses, as well as the presence of focal points in inter-agency coordination, achieved values in 2023 that doubled the baseline of 2019. The integration of AAP in country-level crisis response plans also increased substantially. Interview and survey data gathered for this evaluation also indicate that IOM is making greater efforts to inform affected people and establish CFMs (both are pillars of the AAP Framework). ${ }^{13}$
