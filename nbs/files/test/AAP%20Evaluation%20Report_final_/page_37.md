## 4. RECOMMENDATIONS  ... page 37

IOM should be mindful of the fact that the following recommendations and their recommended actions may have to be implemented in a specific order to optimize benefits. The way these have been ordered here is not suggesting an "optimal" implementation sequence. Finding the optimal implementation sequence is something that IOM will have to undertake in the context of the development of a comprehensive strategy and related action plan for AAP (Recommendation 2).

Some recommendations embed activities that can be considered by IOM for follow-up. Any management response given to these recommendations should elaborate on the merit of the proposed activities, making sure that a robust justification is provided when any activity is discarded.

Recommendation 1: The AAP team should clarify that the scope and applicability of AAP extends beyond emergency response operations, reinforcing also the message on the mandatory nature of $\mathrm{IN} / 285$.

This recommendation responds to findings suggesting that doubts persist regarding the mandatory nature of $\mathrm{IN} / 285$ and its applicability beyond emergency response operations, considering that the instruction focuses specifically on this type of intervention. To this end, a revision of the instruction or the release of other types of official statements specifically addressing these doubts should be considered.

Recommendation 2: The AAP team should develop an operational medium- to longer-term strategy for AAP, to be negotiated at the highest leadership level, with a three-year plan connected to a funding strategy.

This recommendation considers findings on the uneven support for AAP among IOM senior management, placing emphasis on the need to have the strategy endorsed at the level of deputy director generals, or even directly by the Director General. The resulting strategy should also be usable as a fundraising tool to attract more resources towards AAP, while also mobilizing core funding to show the Organization's institutional commitment to AAP.

Recommendation 3: In conjunction with Recommendation 2 above, the AAP team should develop a theory of change and a dedicated monitoring and evaluation framework for AAP.

A more structured strategic approach to AAP will require a dedicated and robust framework for its effective monitoring. A new dedicated framework can build from the current existing framework but will need to feature additional indicators (formulated also on the basis of the findings of this evaluation) and, where necessary, improve the formulation of some of the existing outcome indicators.

The new framework must not be limited to monitoring, but must also include an evaluation plan that can, at a minimum, include reviews or evaluations at regular intervals, or evaluative exercises focused on specific aspects of AAP or initiatives, considering also impact assessments.
