Evaluation questions and themes for the "relevance" criterion: ${ }^{5}$

- EQ1. To what extent is IOM's AAP approach relevant and aligned with the needs and priorities of IOM Member States and the United Nations system (IASC commitments in particular), and of the affected populations and beneficiaries IOM assist?
- EQ2. Are IOM's AAP mechanisms and guidance relevant for IOM offices to enable programming and implementation of AAP in its interventions?
- EQ3. How does IOM's AAP approach consider IOM cross-cutting issues of human rights, gender equality, disability and environment? ${ }^{6}$
- EQ4. To what extent were "relevant marginalized groups" defined/identified by rights-holders themselves?
- EQ5. Are there institutional comparative advantages for AAP approach, which can be identified in the Organization's mandate, to support further advancement in the fields of AAP?
- EQ6. What mechanisms are in place to guarantee that the design and implementation of IOM interventions address power dynamics between affected populations and local and international entities?

Finding 2.3 The IOM AAP Framework is consistent with general United Nations guidance and IASC policies, and there is evidence that affected people were involved in the framework's development. However, the alignment with Member States' perspectives remains unclear, as this aspect was not emphasized during the development of the framework.

This evaluation found that the IOM AAP Framework (IN/285) aligns with IASC guidance (as well as with similar frameworks in place in other entities), through desk review and informants consulted on the matter. The development of the framework entailed thorough reviews of IASC policies and other relevant IOM policies, with the aim of achieving substantial conceptual and theoretical consistency with them. ${ }^{7}$ Some informants also identified that the framework is also relevant to the implementation of the "We Are All In" reporting platform (a flagship initiative in IOM), as it contributes to raising awareness about reporting mechanisms.

    ${ }^{6}$ This list of cross-cutting issues was provided by IOM in the terms of reference for the evaluation; thus, the evaluation does not address how the IOM AAP approach intersects with other cross-cutting issues such as the rights of gender non-binary migrants, children or the elderly, linguistic or cultural minorities.
    ${ }^{7}$ IOM policies and guidelines considered as relevant for or related to IN/285 include the IOM Migration Crisis Operational Framework (MC/2355), the IOM Humanitarian Policy - Principles for Humanitarian Action (C/106/CRP/20), the IOM Standards of Conduct (IN/15, Rev. 1), the IOM Guidance note for mainstreaming protection in IOM crisis response (IN/232), the IOM Policies and Procedures for Preventing and Responding to Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (IN/234), the IOM Gender Equality Policy 2015-2019 (C/106/INF/8/Rev.1), the IOM Data Protection Principles (IN/00138) and the IOM Reporting and Investigation of Misconduct Framework (IN/275).
    ${ }^{8}$ The We Are All In reporting platform is a tool that sends confidential, encrypted reports on different types of misconduct and wrongdoings (including sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment) to the IOM Office of Internal Oversight (OIO).
