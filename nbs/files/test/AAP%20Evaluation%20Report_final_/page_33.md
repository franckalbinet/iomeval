(alongside all the related initiatives led by a small but dedicated AAP unit in IOM Headquarters) marked a fundamental institutional milestone for the sustainability of AAP in IOM, as it established AAP integration as mandatory within the Organization, and gave a legal foundation for the IOM commitment to AAP.

At the same time, this evaluation found that the level of understanding of and support for AAP among senior and leadership officers was unequal (Finding 3.5) and generally insufficient at the central level. ${ }^{23}$ It found that resources for central AAP functions are inadequate, that the AAP unit is undersized vis-à-vis the tasks at hand, and that funding for AAP at the country level largely depends on single projects (Finding 4.1). This has resulted in a fragmented approach and in the whole AAP agenda being driven by initiatives often undertaken in relative isolation, sometimes unable to respond to broader AAP needs that go beyond those of the single funding project. Inefficiencies - with cost implications, as in the case of CFM development and management (Finding 4.3) - are also relevant to the longer-term sustainability of AAP, given the context of inadequate resources.

[^0]:    ${ }^{23}$ The fact that the development of the AAP Framework was funded through project resources, and that central AAP functions depended, at the time of this evaluation, largely on project funding rather than core resources, may support this view.
