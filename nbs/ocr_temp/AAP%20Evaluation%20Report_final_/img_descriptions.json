The chart displays two questions with responses on a 5-point scale (Very low, Low, Moderate, High, Very high, plus 'I don't know'). For 'Increased technical knowledge and capacity concerning AAP since the launch of IN/285': 3% don't know, 27% very high, 23% high, 30% moderate, 16% low, 5% very low. For 'Increased awareness of AAP since the launch of IN/285': 12% don't know, 28% very high, 28% high, 27% moderate, 12% low, 6% very low. The chart uses color-coded bars (cyan, orange, green, yellow, red, blue) corresponding to each response category. The x-axis shows percentages from 0% to 35%.

Mid-range barriers include 'I don't know/Not aware', 'Tools Availability', 'Frontline Action/Local', and 'Stakeholder Coordination'. The shortest bars represent 'CFM', 'Accountability/Commitment', 'Other', and 'Communication/Awareness' at the bottom. The bars are uniformly colored in dark blue, and the chart uses a simple grid layout with vertical gridlines for reference.

The table has 5 columns: Criteria, Questions, IOM staff HQ, IOM staff reg/local, International partners, and Local partners. The table contains 6 evaluation questions related to IOM's AAP (Accountability to Affected Populations) approach. Each question is marked with 'x' indicators showing which stakeholder groups should be consulted. The questions cover: (1) alignment of AAP with IOM Member States and UN system needs, (2) relevance of AAP mechanisms for IOM offices, (3) consideration of cross-cutting issues like human rights and gender equality, (4) engagement of marginalized groups, (5) unique aspects of IOM's AAP implementation, and (6) consideration of power differences in project design. Most questions involve consultation with IOM staff HQ and regional/local staff, with select questions also involving international and local partners."
