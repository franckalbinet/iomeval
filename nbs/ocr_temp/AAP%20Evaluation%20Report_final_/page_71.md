#### Brief Introduction ... page 71

IOM has launched the Accountability to Affected Populations Framework which became a mandatory Instruction 285 (IN/285) in 2021. The AAP Framework lays out five overall commitments: (a) leadership; (b) information-sharing and transparency; (c) participation; (d) complaints and feedback mechanisms; and (e) partner coordination. The AAP team at IOM has been providing technical assistance, trainings, and internal alliances to help implement the framework. This evaluation has the purpose of evaluating IOM's strategy and operations in the field of AAP.
