developing normative guidance, creating toolkits, conducting training sessions, providing technical support, disseminating information, managing knowledge and establishing an internal AAP community of practice.

The AAP Coordination Unit is tasked with monitoring AAP implementation within IOM. It coordinates data collection and consolidation for the assessment of these indicators. Informants from within the unit stated that qualitative data collection was also being carried out to complement these quantitative indicators. The quantitative and qualitative data collected were analysed and presented against a definition of the four main areas of activity related to AAP: to provide information to affected people; to encourage and enhance participation from affected people; to establish and use feedback mechanisms to improve programming; and to participate in inter-agency AAP coordination spaces.

Assessing progress and impact in the realm of AAP is inherently complex due to the crosssectional nature of the AAP Framework; this is a challenge encountered not solely by IOM but also across the broader humanitarian sector. To tackle this issue, IASC has established a working group tasked with developing standard indicators for AAP in humanitarian contexts. ${ }^{3}$

### Evaluation Purpose, Objectives and Scope  ... page 10

IOM, through CED, decided to carry out a strategic and thorough evaluation of its efforts and accomplishments in the area of AAP. This evaluation is part of the CED 2023-2024 Biennial evaluation workplan, and is considered an aspect of a larger institutional initiative to ensure that AAP commitments are fulfilled. The aim of this evaluation was to provide recommendations for actions at various levels, based on a general review of AAP within IOM.

In particular, the evaluation concentrated on:

- IOM global engagement with AAP in both emergency and non-emergency situations, covering policies, strategies and programmatic methods established since 2016 (that is, before the launch of the AAP Framework).
- Best practices and opportunities for improvement regarding IOM decision-making, policy formulation, technical guidance and programme execution for a holistic and cooperative AAP approach, as well as to ensure external alignment with United Nations agencies, other organizations and governments.
- The progress on implementing the 2019 MOPAN recommendations related to AAP and IASC commitments, especially in light of the 2023 MOPAN review of IOM.
- Field-based examination of IOM contributions to regional and national projects and community-based approaches to AAP.
- Activities conducted within the IASC task force and other groups.
- The comparative advantage of IOM in system-wide, strategic solutions and responses, and how sustainability can be further improved.
