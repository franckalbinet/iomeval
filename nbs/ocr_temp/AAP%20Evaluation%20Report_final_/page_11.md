The evaluation did not focus on the implementation of AAP within specific projects. Instead, it examined AAP activities worldwide based on aggregated data from national, regional and global levels.

The intended audience for this evaluation includes IOM management, IOM staff engaged in implementing the AAP approach at Headquarters and in the field, interested donors, Member States and both international and local partners.

The evaluation employed the six standard criteria of the OECD Development Assistance Committee: relevance, coherence, efficiency, effectiveness, impact and sustainability (OECD, 2024). It also incorporated an analysis of the cross-cutting themes of gender, disability, environment and human rights-based approaches, as they intersected with AAP within IOM. The complete list of evaluation questions can be found in Annex A.

### Methodology  ... page 11

A mixed methods approach was implemented for this exercise. The triangulation of various data sources was crucial in achieving consistent and valid evaluation findings. Triangulation involves assessing multiple data sources to compare differing perspectives and ensure reliability when reporting evaluation findings, accounting for diverse viewpoints and supporting conclusions with robust evidence. The resources gathered for this exercise encompassed official IOM documents, feedback from participants at IOM and partner organizations, at local government levels, from within affected populations and from civil society organizations, where relevant, such as in the case studies.

The data for this evaluation were gathered using several methods: desk reviews; key informant interviews (KII); focus group discussions (FGDs); a global survey; and two case studies on AAP implementation in Ethiopia and Türkiye.

#### Desk Review ... page 11

The desk review examined key background documents related to IOM (including the strategic review of its results-based management work (IOM 2023g), the 2023 MOPAN assessment, and various IOM manuals addressing protection and reintegration, among others), as well as documents specifically related to AAP work (such as the AAP Framework, tools on information, participation and complaints mechanisms, and annual reports) and information on specific selected countries (Ethiopia and Türkiye). Throughout the entire evaluation process, there was
