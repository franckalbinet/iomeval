dedicated to AAP in IOM Headquarters, with the rest of the team consisting of five consultants (funded by the USAID Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance based on a project agreement).

Finding 4.2. Training and learning resources made available by the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters function to increase awareness of AAP and capacity, but there is still unmet demand for learning, especially when it comes to resources and support for bridging theory and practice.

Data collected for this evaluation clearly show that awareness and understanding of AAP concepts within IOM have increased since 2021. According to the evaluation survey, 56 per cent of respondents confirmed their awareness of AAP had grown since 2021, while 80 per cent reports very high to moderate improvement in their knowledge and technical capacity regarding APP over the same period (Figure 5).

Informants generally recognized that this progress was, at least in part, due to the training initiatives led by the AAP unit in IOM Headquarters. Informants involved in the facilitation or design of these trainings perceived them as "popular" among IOM staff based on how the response of trainees and their participation was perceived (however, neither exact figures on attendance, nor pre-training and post-training assessments were reviewed as part of this evaluation). At the same time, several informants, especially those operating in country offices, mentioned that capacity gaps persisted and lamented an often "superficial" understanding of AAP principles and concepts among the "average" IOM staffer, due to lack of practical knowledge on how to implement AAP in actual operational settings and in a nonimprovisational manner. Informants interviewed for both the IOM Türkiye and the IOM Ethiopia case studies provided similar remarks on a gap between understanding AAP and ability to implement it.
