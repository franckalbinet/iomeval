## KEY FINDINGS \& CONCLUSIONS ... page 2

The JI-HoA supported migrants in dangerous environments with basic emergency care. It provided returnees (who returned with nothing) with a basis to start their reintegration and enhanced economic opportunities for communities as a whole. Therefore, the JI-HoA addressed key priorities of vulnerable populations in the region. Only sporadic examples were found where specific interventions did not meet the needs of the beneficiaries.

While governments where highly interested in the JIHoA, urgent problems such as COVID-19, security issues and economic crises prevented governments from treating return migration as a priority.
The evaluation found extensive examples of collaboration and alignment between the JI-HoA and other initiatives. The JI-HoA aligned with priorities of regional partners (IGAD).
The Programme has in general met the targets for the specific objectives and their associated results and in many cases even surpassing its targets.
Specific Objective 1: The JI-HoA achieved increased use of data in policymaking, strategies, processes and plans for return and reintegration. However, external factors and staff turnover may hinder the longer-term effectiveness of capacity-building efforts.
Specific Objective 2: The JI-HoA has enabled safe, humane, and dignified return of migrants while taking into consideration their needs and vulnerabilities. However, gaps remain with regards to coordination mechanisms and referral partners for specialized services.
Specific Objective 3: The vast majority of returnees reported sufficient levels of economic self-sufficiency, social stability and psychosocial wellbeing in their community of return. Community members noted that community projects contributed positively to economic and employment opportunities in the community.
However, different thresholds to measure the sustainability of reintegration were used throughout the project, each of which provide a different picture. External factors also affect the level of reintegration.
The financial and human resources were deemed sufficient to meet the programme's objectives in terms of achieving the project outcomes and results. The top-up system was necessary to finance services and reach the objectives of the JI. Although there were delays in some activities, almost all final results were met by the end of the implementation period of the programme.

The programme used resources well to achieve its results, and even introduced cost-cutting activities. Some activities became more efficient during the programme implementation. Although the JI-HoA was effective in forming partnerships with service providers, additional measures are needed to ensure the stability and financial independence of these actors to increase the efficiency gains created.
Government officials and other stakeholders have reported an increase in their capacity to work on return and reintegration. This has already resulted in the introduction of new policies and processes. However, the current sense of ownership and capacities of the governments do not seem enough to continue work on return and reintegration without IOM support.
The JI-HoA was a unique effort to support return and reintegration in a highly complex political and economic context. The scope of the support provided required extensive investment of resources by IOM and stakeholders, but created valuable, even life-saving benefits for beneficiaries

The complexity of the JI-HoA, and the fragility of existing systems in the Horn of Africa countries, leads to the conclusion that ownership and sustainability of the programme cannot be expected after five years of implementation. Important progress has been made, but continued support is needed in terms of capacity-building, but also for wider socio-economic development and security in the four countries in general .

## KEY RECOMMENDATIONS ... page 2

1. Enhance efforts with national, regional, and local stakeholders to build capacity and ownership
2. Strengthen community-based reintegration efforts to address irregular migration and provide economic opportunities that reduce the necessity to migrate.
3. Increase attention to building partnerships with service providers who can function without funding .
4. Explore opportunities for the continued (co-)funding of key, effective, and relevant activities in line with those supported under the JI-HOA.
5. Explore opportunities to extent the scope of support provided to returnees
6. Continue supporting and strengthening safe, humane, and orderly migration pathways.
7. Build on the results of the IMPACT evaluation conducted under the JI-HoA by continuing to test and adjust the tools to measure reintegration sustainability
