## PROJECT SUMMARY ... page 1

In 2016, the EU and IOM launched the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration, with as overall objective "To contribute to facilitating orderly, safe, regular and rights-based migration through the facilitation of dignified voluntary return and the implementation of development-focused and sustainable reintegration policies and processes". The EU-IOM Joint Initiative in the Horn of Africa (JI-HOA) commenced in March 2017 with a focus on Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan.

The JI-HoA includes various pillars, including Assisted Voluntary Return of migrants, and an integrated approach to reintegration that supports both returnees and their communities.

The integrated approach targets three societal levels:
Individual level: Initiatives to address the specific needs and vulnerabilities of returnees and returning family members.

Community level: Initiatives that respond to the needs, vulnerabilities, and concerns of communities to which migrants return.

Structural/system level: Initiatives that promote good governance of migration through engagement with local and national authorities .
