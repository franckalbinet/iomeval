The current evaluation comprises the final ${ }^{1,2}$, external evaluation of the JI-HoA, as final component of the project closure. The primary users of the evaluation are IOM, the donor, and external partners engaged in future programming involving Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration. The evaluation has multiple purposes, namely accountability (summative evaluation, looking into the effectiveness of the JI) and learning (formative evaluation, looking to improve future programming). In particular, the evaluation provides recommendations for future migrant protection, return and reintegration programming.

The evaluation followed the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development/Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC) evaluation criteria and quality standards. The evaluation considered individual interventions in the four countries as well as their interconnectedness and synergies with the programme as a whole. The evaluation will present the most visible trends, common strengths, and weaknesses across the countries.

Each evaluation question includes the main data collection methods that will be used to collect information to answer the question, as well as key indicators that measure trends or the state of play/level regarding the change or situation the evaluation question refers to.

The evaluation was built on a mixed-methods data collection approach, including primary and secondary quantitative and qualitative data. Given the volume of data collected and compiled by IOM, desk research comprised a first and important step of the data collection.

- Initial desk research was carried out in the inception phase to help the evaluation team better understand the initiative. Additionally, given the vast amount of research carried out during the programme implementation, the team aimed to structure this data to identify gaps and areas for validation, while avoiding duplication and disproportionate pressure on stakeholders.
