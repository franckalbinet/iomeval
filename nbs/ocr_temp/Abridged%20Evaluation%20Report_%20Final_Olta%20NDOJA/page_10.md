##### 4.1.1.1 Needs of migrants ... page 10

Desk research and interviews confirm that the programme responded to the most pressing needs of migrants. The JI-HoA enabled them to return from dangerous environments, such as detention, where no other support was available. Migrants shared that they suffered on their irregular migration journeys, had acutely distressing experiences ${ }^{13}$, and highlighted that their families and communities could not help them ${ }^{14}$. Stakeholders supporting migrants in Djibouti stressed in this regard that the most urgent problems were prioritised, such as hunger, thirst, and fatigue. The JI-HoA, first of all, tried to save their lives by providing the necessary means to survive, such as food, water, clothing and shelter ${ }^{15}$.

However, the survey among migrants in MRC indicated that, while $68 \%$ of respondents were satisfied with the MRC services, only $39 \%$ reported that the MRCs met all or almost all their needs. IOM explained this number by noting that a large majority of respondents were surveyed while still waiting for their Assisted Voluntary Return and Reintegration (AVRR), which suggests that the support was not provided immediately. Therefore, quicker service provision and AVRR were among the most listed elements for improvement by the respondents. ${ }^{16}$

##### 4.1.1.2 Needs of returnees ... page 10

The JI-HoA responded to a large extent to the needs of returnees in terms of their reintegration. Namely, upon arrival, returnees are faced with a lack of economic resources to sustain themselves, face stigma and exclusion from community members and experience effects of their distressing migration experiences that affect their ability to rebuild their lives. Therefore, the integrated approach to economic, social, and psychosocial support was of a great relevance to the challenges faced by returnees.
