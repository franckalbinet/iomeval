Despite these achievements, stakeholders in Djibouti noted that additional steps still need to be taken to improve data gathering capacities. ${ }^{48}$ Similarly, a Sudanese stakeholder noted that "all data needed for policymaking is now available to them, although capacity to use this data could still be strengthened further". ${ }^{49}$

Capacity of stakeholders  ... page 17

The IOM logframe shows that the programme exceeded the targeted number of stakeholders "strengthened through capacity building or operational support on reintegration" (665 instead of 434). ${ }^{50}$ The IOM logframe and surveys show that in each country, the majority of surveyed stakeholders declared increased knowledge on return and reintegration issues ( $97 \%$ average across the four countries). ${ }^{51}$ The JI also met its target set for the "number of national/regional/local networks and dialogues on migration related issues newly established or functionally enhanced" (namely 29).

While an increase in capacity is identified by stakeholders themselves, this does not necessarily reflect their actual capacity. For example, the 2021 stakeholder survey noted that $22 \%$ of stakeholders perceive that they now have larger financial allocations of their institutional budget for migration issues than that of their budget prior to their engagement in the EU-IOM Joint Initiative. ${ }^{52}$ This also demonstrates that in $78 \%$ of the cases, no additional budget or resources has been allocated (likely to a large extent due to COVID, conflict, etc.). This is a key finding, as capacity alone is not sufficient for governments and stakeholders to continue working on, and improving, return and reintegration policies and processes.

This evaluation has found various examples of the increased use of data in policymaking, strategies, processes and plans for return and reintegration. However, various challenges were found that hinder stakeholders from optimally benefitting from increased data and capacity.

According to IOM's survey of stakeholders, 136 stakeholders reported that data produced has supported evidence-based policies, procedures, and programme design, which exceeds the original target of $42 .{ }^{53}$ There are some examples where the migration data is already used by legal entities (e.g., Women and Social Affairs Ministry in Ethiopia has initiated a mandate to work with the national returnee database ${ }^{54}$ ), however in most cases local governments are not ready yet to overtake the task of
