as COVID-19, security issues and economic crises prevented them from treating return migration as a priority throughout the implementation of the JI-HoA. Before the implementation of the JI-HoA programme, in most countries, there were limited frameworks or mechanism for migration, governments had no tools, and no national capacity building strategies which in turn led to limited capacity to facilitate return and reintegration. The JI-HoA programme addressed this gap through capacity building activities and tools such as the SOPs and various guidelines. ${ }^{29}$

Interviews revealed that the efforts of the JI-HoA regarding migration data were of particular relevance and importance to the stakeholders. Namely, there was a clear lack of data on migration and existing tools and methods to collect such data were not harmonized across the region. Therefore, data between countries could not be compared. ${ }^{31}$

##### 4.1.2.2 Needs of other stakeholders  ... page 13

Generally, the interview analysis revealed that the needs of the other national stakeholders were identified and addressed by the programme. The survey of partners, presented in the Partnership Analysis assessment that was conducted under the programme, showed that $82 \%$ of partners believed IOM's local capacity building activities were useful. ${ }^{33}$ The partnership analysis report concluded that the differences between implementing partners (IPs) on "technical capacity, work experience with international organisations, and reporting ability" were prominent from the beginning of the programme. Therefore, IOM's training for IPs on various topics were necessary to mitigate these differences ${ }^{33}$.

However, despite this support, some partners identified areas where the programme could improve. Some of the IPs found the active guidance of the IOM less relevant, as they perceived themselves as having more experience and knowledge than the $\mathrm{IOM}^{34}$ or that the capacity building was not necessary since they already had enough capacity ${ }^{35}$.
