According to data from the Migration Database of the African Union Institute for Statistics (STATAFRIC), the African migration population has increased significantly between 2010 and 2019, from 17.2 million to 26.3 million. In the IGAD ${ }^{3}$ region, the migrant population grew from 3.1 million to 6.5 million during this time, which means migration more than doubled. ${ }^{4}$

The Horn of Africa has historically and presently witnessed significant flows of migration, both regular and irregular, voluntary, and forced, and temporary and permanent. Various factors affect migration, including economic development, conflicts, degradation of the environment, disasters, and poverty. Most emigrants remain within the IGAD region. ${ }^{5}$ Less data is available on irregular migration, even though irregular migration is widespread in the region.

In addition, the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for stability and addressing root causes of irregular migration and displaced persons in Africa (EUTF for Africa) was created in 2015 to address the root causes of instability, forced displacement and irregular migration and to contribute to better migration management. Funded under the EUTF, the EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration aims to protect and save migrants' lives and strengthen migration governance, in full respect of international human rights standards and in particular the principle of non-refoulement. The EU-IOM Joint Initiative covers and closely cooperates with 26 African countries in the Sahel and Lake Chad, the Horn of Africa, and North Africa.

The EU-IOM Joint Initiative for Migrant Protection and Reintegration in the Horn of Africa, launched in March 2017, assists countries in the region participating in the Khartoum Process (focusing particularly on Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan) to facilitate orderly, safe, and regular migration through the development and implementation of rights-based, development-based and sustainable return and reintegration policies and processes.

The initial budget of the programme was 25 million, funded by the EU through the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa (EUTF) - Horn of Africa Window, for a period of 36 months. Through a top-up system, the budget increased five times to a final total of 64.702 .979 EUR for 66.5 months. This budget covered activities in Djibouti, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan, as well as regional activities.

The overarching framework for the JI-HoA is IOM's "integrated approach to reintegration". The aim of this approach is to better connect various interventions supporting reintegration, in order to provide a holistic package of support to returnees and their host communities.
