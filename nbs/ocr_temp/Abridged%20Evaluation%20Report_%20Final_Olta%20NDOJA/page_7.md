### 2.2. External factors affecting the implementation of the JI  ... page 7

Over the course of the Programme, multiple challenges outside the control of the IOM and its partners affected the implementation of the JI-HoA at the global and national levels.

The global COVID-19 pandemic was first detected in each of the four programme countries in March 2020 and continued to spread after its initial discovery. The restrictions implemented led to some difficulties in the Programme's implementation as workshops and activities became harder to conduct or had to be postponed. Direct assistance was also hindered by lockdowns.

Although not explicitly named in interviews, Russia's invasion of Ukraine on the $24^{\text {th }}$ of February 2022 is another factor that is likely to have impacted the final months as well as sustainability of the JI-HoA. The imposition of sanctions on Russia's energy sector led to a sharp rise in the price of hydrocarbons. ${ }^{7}$

Several country-level events influenced the implementation and impact of the JI-HoA as well:

- In Ethiopia, the conflict in Tigray which started in 2020 affected the return of migrants, distribution of reintegration assistance and conducting monitoring surveys in this region. ${ }^{8}$
- In Djibouti, risks to the Programme stemmed from the issues in other countries such as Ethiopia or Somalia spilling over into Djibouti. ${ }^{9}$
- In Somalia, the complicated security environment affected the smooth implementation of the Programme, e.g. continuous mortar attacks in airport compound. ${ }^{10}$
- In Sudan, the Programme was affected by rapidly rising inflation, political instability, a political coup and high turnover of government representatives. ${ }^{14}$
