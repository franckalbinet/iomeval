According to the RA Monitoring and Satisfaction surveys, 56\% of the surveyed returnees were satisfied or very satisfied with the reintegration assistance support provided by the JI-HoA ${ }^{17}$.

Focus Group Discussions highlighted the importance of the economic assistance to enable returnees to develop sources of income (e.g. through start-up businesses or employment). Since returnees are coming back usually "empty-handed", they are experiencing shame, guilt, and are stigmatised by their communities and relatives. The economic support offered by the JI-HoA not only provides them with resources to start their business but also restores their dignity and self-trust ${ }^{18}$.

In the Focus Group Discussions (FGDs), some returnees pointed out that the overall value of the economic assistance was not enough. ${ }^{19}$ This was also confirmed by a stakeholder from Sudan, who suggested that returnees needed more money to satisfy their livelihood during the time of planting, growing and harvesting, since they put most of the microbusiness support into the producing and often have no other sources of income ${ }^{20}$. The microbusiness assistance did not always correspond to the knowledge of the recipient or the local context. Namely, a few of the returnees revealed that they were not consulted or received different support than they selected, so they had no other option, but just to accept the support ${ }^{21}$.

In terms of psychosocial needs, research results presented at the Research and Evidence Facility (REF) conference of June 2022 indicated that the incidence of Common Mental Disorders (CMD) is significantly higher among JI-HoA beneficiaries in Ethiopia when compared with non-migrant control group ${ }^{22}$. The high prevalence of CMD among returned migrants from the Middle East was also found in another study ${ }^{23}$. This indicates that irregular migrants are much more affected by the CMD compared to people who do not migrate. The specific focus of the JI-HoA on MHPSS therefore addresses key difficulties faced by migrants.

However, in the execution, some gaps were found in the correspondence of specific activities to returnees' psychosocial needs. The JI-HoA Programme's Lessons Learned from the Psychosocial Support Component Report noted gaps in the post-return psychosocial support (e.g., lack of MHPSS service, unclear information about compensation of the treatment, high cost, stigma, and low awareness about MHPSS needs among communities) ${ }^{24}$. The post-return psychosocial support was not wellintegrated into the main documents of the JI-HoA programme ${ }^{25}$. This lack of attention led to the lack of
