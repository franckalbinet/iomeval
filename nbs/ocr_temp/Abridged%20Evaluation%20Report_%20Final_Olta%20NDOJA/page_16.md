Overall score on IOM's achievements: 3.4/5
Robustness score for the evidence: $4 / 5$

The effectiveness of the JI was measured through one overarching objective and three Specific Objectives (each is discussed in a dedicated section below) with several result areas per Specific Objective. Indicators and targets were developed for the overall objective, outcomes, and result areas. According to the 2019 mid-term evaluation of the programme, the implementation of all pillars of the programme was "on good track" and some initial results were noted (e.g. effectiveness in reaching its target groups, provision of AVRR assistance). ${ }^{44}$

The current evaluation found that the targets for the overall objective were surpassed and that the achievements towards the three specific outcomes are supporting the achievement of the overall objective. Namely, the Programme has in general met the targets for the specific objectives and their associated result areas, and at times even surpassing the targets ${ }^{45}$.

The current evaluation concludes that the Horn of Africa faced significant gaps in data on human migration, towards which the JI made substantial progress. The IOM logframe shows that the JI exceeded the targets set for the "number of field studies, surveys and other research conducted under the programme" ( 20 instead of 19). ${ }^{45}$ The increased availability of migration data (result 1.1.) was achieved mainly through the production and the publication of migration data and research outputs by the Regional Data Hub and the RDH's engagement with National Statistical Offices (NSOs) and key
