The JI-HoA programme is well aligned with the objectives of the key regional actors, such as IGAD and African Union and their frameworks and activities.

The IGAD adopted a Regional Migration Policy Framework that aimed to comprehensively address the variety of issues related to unsupported migration in the IGAD region. The main goal of this framework was to provide advice and further strategies to support comprehensive migration management, to harmonise policies between countries, and to recommend and support formulating good policies in migration. The JI-HoA was aligned with the work of IGAD mainly in two pillars: gathering and disseminating quality data on migration and capacity building of the national governments ${ }^{40}$.

Another important framework is the Intergovernmental Authority on Development Regional Consultative Process on Migration (IGAD-RCP). In this joint work, the organizations involved worked on policy harmonization, policy development and capacity building ${ }^{41}$. Also, under the JI-HoA, IGAD started discussions about new initiatives on developing a child policy and regional AVRR framework ${ }^{42}$.

The JI-HoA was created on the basis of the commitments made by European and African leaders and is built on a partnership between the EU, the African Union (AU) and the UN ${ }^{43}$. The JI-HoA mostly corresponds to two main pillars of the Migration policy framework for Africa and Plan of Action (2018-2030) developed by the AUC, namely, 1) migration governance; and 2) irregular migration (including returns).

Overall, coordination between IOM and other UN agencies and NGOs led to a lack of duplications and created opportunities for complementarity. Interviewees mostly agree that duplication is hardly possible due to the scope of support needed for the return migration and the fact that the JI-HoA programme has a unique integrated approach to the return and reintegration processes.

An IOM regional representative shared the procedure how they were structuring the process of avoiding potential duplication across different initiatives in each country:

We would map out the developmental activities carried out in a given country by NGO's, other UN agencies, etc., and try to create the link between our returnees and activities of other actors so that they could be inserted within ongoing activities. We were not just replicating, but also trying to avoid duplicating what was already was already going on.

In short, the JI-HoA was able to build partnerships and complementarity with other development and aid organisations in the region, while avoiding duplication. This has also affected, to some extent, the cost-effectiveness of the JI-HoA, which is presented in the efficiency chapter.
