    "## Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "UN agencies produce extensive evaluation reports and other public documents. For IOM, this body of knowledge is extensive and variegated, but putting it to practical use becomes more challenging as volume increases, particularly when documentation is stored across different repositories with no single index available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge for IOM**\n",
    "\n",
    "IOM's evaluation production is highly decentralized, with reports stored across multiple repositories (the [IOM Evaluation Repository](https://evaluation.iom.int/evaluation-search-pdf), IOM Library, IOM Protection Platform). Quality varies greatly—quality control processes are not applied uniformly, and variation also reflects the inherent subjectivity in evaluation approaches and interpretations. Reports also vary significantly in structure: some follow common formats with executive summaries, findings, and recommendations, while others have different structures entirely. This inconsistency makes systematic mapping challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critically, existing metadata doesn't indicate which elements of IOM's strategic frameworks—the [Strategic Results Framework (SRF)](https://srf.iom.int/) or the [Global Compact for Migration (GCM)](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/generalassembly/docs/globalcompact/A_RES_73_195.pdf)—each report addresses. This is a major gap that limits the ability to connect evaluation evidence with key strategic frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evidence Maps as a Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "Evidence Maps display the extent and nature of research and evaluation available on a subject. Following the [2025 UNEG Eval Week](https://www.unevaluation.org/events/uneg-evaluation-week-2025), four primary use cases emerged: guiding future evidence generation, informing policy decisions, knowledge management, and enhancing collaboration. The maps created by `iomeval` serve primarily as **knowledge management tools**—structured repositories that make identifying relevant sources easier by organizing them against strategic framework components.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What This Enables**\n",
    "\n",
    "By tagging reports against SRF outputs, enablers, cross-cutting priorities, and GCM objectives, these maps help answer questions like: Which framework elements are well-covered by existing evaluations? Where are the knowledge gaps that should prioritize future evaluation work? Which themes have enough evidence for a dedicated synthesis report?"
